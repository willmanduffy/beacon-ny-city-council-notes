## Fishkill Avenue Concepts

### Topic

The Fishkill Avenue Committee presented initial zoning recommendations for the corridor, focusing on creating a more pedestrian-friendly environment while managing future development.

### Discussion

Four key zoning recommendations were presented:

1. Prohibit new self-storage facilities due to low employment generation and limited contribution to corridor vitality
2. Prohibit new drive-through facilities due to pedestrian safety concerns and traffic congestion
3. Reduce minimum front yard setbacks from 15 to 10 feet and require parking behind buildings
4. Phase out auto-oriented uses (gas stations, car washes, vehicle sales, auto repair) while grandfathering existing businesses

Additional non-zoning recommendations include:

- Creating access points to future rail trail

- Adding landscaping and stormwater management features
- Protecting scenic views
- Considering appropriate building heights

### Concerns Raised
