0:16
all right hey everybody so for those of you who are unaware this is a workshop uh that means
0:23
the council does its homework public can be here although there won't be public comments uh let's do roll call I see the
0:31
City attorney has just walked in a city administrator uh George Pam Paloma Lee
0:38
Amber Jeff Molly we're all here anyone online with the city I don't think so
0:43
right correct and I see our city planner Natalie Quinn thank you for coming uh
0:50
we're expecting our fish kill Avenue committee chair uh JC calron I assume will be here okay um let's do the the
1:00
first item and get the chief home so this is the appointment of Anthony
1:05
Lombardo the position of police officer you're going to tell us about
1:11
it good evening it's nice to be here again I'm very pleased to be here to uh
1:17
propose the hiring of another person for the position of police officer even Police Department Anthony James Lombardo
1:23
is 24 years old he resided in this area his whole life and been born and raised in Cold Spring New York where he
1:29
attended h high school or everything school um Anthony's currently a police
1:36
officer in the NYPD and prior to that he worked as a laborer and a carpenter as a and as a for for a property management
1:42
firm he's also engaged in significant volunteer work in his community to include um preparing meals for local
1:48
homeless shelter as well as participating in the Polar Plunge to raise money for the Special Olympics as with all of our candidates
1:55
Mr Lombardo passed our background check process which includes interviewing neighbors and Associates checking into the individual's finances social media
2:02
checking into their criminal and domestic and academic employment history Tom can you turn your mic on is it off
2:08
or did I just not have it well I don't know I don't see the red and Ben said he's having trouble hearing you okay
2:14
that one doesn't turn off keep going sorry okay might have just been a before
2:19
that's better okay do you want me to go through it for the record um domestic and academic and
2:26
employment history and among other things passing reg good psychological polygraph exam we're looking forward to
2:32
Bringing officer Lombardo on board soon and continuing to address our staffing for shortfalls as rapidly as we
2:39
can so would this did we miss the window for the upcoming um Academy so he would
2:45
not need to attend the academy because he would be what's called a resignation reinstatement he already has one um what
2:50
we would have to do is send him to a few weeks of what's called a conversion course okay and there's no like set time
2:57
like that's something that there be one coming up um orange County and Rockland County both do them they're a couple of weeks long okay and would there then be
3:03
field training after that or depends on he actually um when he starts he'll start field training right away okay so
3:10
he can do those two things concurrently it sounds like yeah that just has to the conversion course just has to be done
3:16
within a year oh
3:24
great all right it's exciting that there's somebody uh else so soon after
3:29
the other two appointments so hopefully this is the trend I am pretty pleased we had two more resumes sent to us so okay
3:36
great good we're hopeful for those um and we talked about it last time any
3:41
updates on when the test results from the last test in the fall will be released or you're still waiting yet no
3:48
okay great thank
3:54
you all right any other questions no so Mr Lombardo will be here next week
4:01
me right thank you all so much I'll see you next week thank you try get home
4:07
safely I know it's a long ways
4:13
yeah okay uh next one so by the way I think the council knows this there's
4:19
some fairly meaty stuff on this agenda we may not get through it all but let's start up um what I would suggest we do
4:26
is uh oh do we want to dispense with with items 567 and get them out of the
4:32
way would that be all right with Council CU I believe those are pretty quick right yes yep and do you need a motion
4:39
do I need a motion it is a res it is an agenda so yes all right so um motion to
4:44
move items five six and seven uh to next items on the agenda and a second so
4:51
that's Molly and Amber all in favor I I I thank you very much okay so let's get
4:56
get the easy ones and then we'll have the mey discussions to follow so this the next one's the appointment of Corey
5:01
worthman to the position of acting building inspector Chris you want to start that
5:06
one I'm sure this is uh tentative and we put it on because as you know um our building inspector Bruce flower is going
5:14
back to work for the town of pipy um he was a deputy there he's now taking the
5:19
building inspector position and um we have a deputy building inspector who is
5:24
going to be acting as as the building inspector and we're still determining with civil service what steps we need to
5:31
take so I just wanted to put this on in case we need to bring him to you next week he's fully qualified to do the job
5:38
he did it in olster County um and as we look for a a permanent candidate he
5:43
would be filling in in some capacity so if if we do declare him acting building
5:48
inspector which may be necessary then we'll um have more information on him next week and you did hire him not not
5:57
too long ago maybe six months ago we hired him and he's been fabulous is the question for civil service like whether
6:04
he can serve as the acting building inspector or whether he needs to remain as Deputy like what are we trying to
6:10
determine he he actually can do a lot of the things that the building inspector does just as Deputy in the absence of
6:17
the building inspector what we're trying to figure out is if we have to create a position of acting um what what that
6:25
would mean in terms of pay um so we have some stuff to work out but if we do this
6:30
we would need to do it next week and I wanted to at least get it on your radar okay um so we're in the process of
6:36
collecting more information Chris could you describe who else is in the building department just Staffing wise just we
6:43
have a sense of yeah you have another building inspect Deputy building inspector um you have the person that
6:49
oversees planning and zoning and then there is a administrative assistant and I don't know his exact title um but you
6:58
have five in that department and we're losing the head of it can can we expect any slowdowns in um
7:05
you know um Billy um permits being issued or anything like that hopefully
7:11
not uh we'll we'll do our best to make the transition seamless and and again I
7:17
think um Bruce has left the department a lot stronger than he found it it's um it
7:23
he's he's mostly caught up we had a a big backlog from covid when he came in
7:28
um I think he has more staff now than we had previously so the staff can carry a
7:34
lot of it Forward some of some of the things that we might elect to do that we
7:39
don't have to do we may have to delay a few months while the next person gets up to speed but I don't think the permits I
7:46
don't think will slow down a lot yeah we added a position a couple of budgets ago
7:52
or the last budget I forget which one or the other and that's the one that Corey filled I I think we'd be in
8:00
a harder shape if we didn't have that position but I think with it I think we it gives us a little bit of back stop
8:06
doesn't mean we can't you know we don't need to fill the slot we do but we have some room now and not directly related
8:13
to this but sort of um I I'd spoken with Bruce a few months ago and I know he was requesting a um like a large format
8:20
scanner to document all of um like old plans and various stuff like that and I
8:26
don't know if that was included in the budget it was it was yeah and just he hasn't had a chance to buy it so it's
8:32
still forthcoming good cuz he he implied to me that that was going to really help um executing permit yeah it's still in
8:39
the plans to buy okay everybody all right I'm sorry
8:44
go ahead no that's okay um I I I this is a request I guess for any person who's
8:50
leaving us I assume that if anything relevant comes up in um Bruce's exit
8:55
interview um as we if it's relevant to hiring the next person that that would
9:01
be incorporated um by Sarah I I will leave that up to Sarah yeah yeah um I
9:08
mean it sounds like Bruce is leaving just because there's a bigger opportunity in a bigger city um still if
9:14
there's anything relevant he was in that position for 18 years and then the person above him retired so we basically
9:20
borrowed him for two and a half years from the town of gyy he also will focus more on the building aspect and less on
9:27
zoning and planning CU they break that down between multiple staff so they have
9:32
a person who oversees Planning and Zoning He he'll do building then they have a code enforcement person he's kind
9:38
of all three of those here right so they're a bigger city than us yeah they're three times our size and um the
9:45
town of pipy plus they've just got a a ton of the commercial right because they got a very very large section of rout
9:52
nine um so um with if he does become
9:57
acting I don't think we met him in person cuz that's not our appro our procedure with deputies but if he does
10:02
become acting head or head if we're able to meet him either as a public session or executive session just to kind of get
10:09
to know him as we did with Bruce kind of like have a just ability for the council to kind of get to know him I think would
10:15
be to check his availability he's also a fire chief and has a lot of commitments
10:20
yeah maybe it's not necessary for us to vote on no no it's not necessar for next week soorry to be clear I'm just
10:26
thinking for because we did get a chance to meet other heads of departments who I I would just say probably the permanent
10:32
person we would bring into to me of course or do that in executive session but for an acting I I wouldn't necessar
10:39
yeah I'll defer to you once you learn more about how long he might be acting for and that might also dictate what
10:45
seems appropriate both from a practical and from a legal perspective so um and
10:50
then Chris I'm sorry if you said this and I missed it but what will the hiring process be for the the it we have a
10:57
civil service list for the position we're canvasing that list right now which has uh seven qualified candidates
11:04
on it and we'll see if anyone on the list is a person we want to hire and
11:10
then we will see if we need to stick with the list or we are able to break the list and then consider other
11:17
candidates great okay yes all right that's that one
11:24
and then the second one is uh renewing our leas license agreement with Cornell Cooperative
11:30
uh Nick you want to tell us what's in that thank you mayor so this is a license agreement with Cornell
11:35
Cooperative for use of certain space within the recreation center there's a figure attached to this um license
11:41
agreement detailing that space as well as the scope of the of the use um it's in connection with Cornell's green teens
11:48
program and this is a license agreement for a one-year term running a calendar year so it's retroactive to January 1st
11:55
of this year through December 31st and it also provides for four renewal rul by the city administrator and the
12:02
particulars are they're paying a monthly rent of $350 a month payable in one lump sum for $3,000 the agreement provides
12:09
for all the required insurance and also provides that if it's needed for another public use or necessary at the
12:15
discretion of a recreation director that the agreement can be terminated is there anything that's
12:21
different about this contract other than it being renewal from what we've had with them previously not substantively
12:27
it's still the same use as my understanding and we've just added some additional requirements on insurance and just updated it for Best Practices but
12:33
the use Remains the Same thank you and the terms are the same
12:39
yes were there any other nonprofits that were interested in um using the
12:44
facilities I don't how how did this process come they've been doing this for
12:50
since before I got here in 2000 in early 2021 um if if groups want to use the
12:57
facilities Mark talks with them and to accommodate them but this is a more
13:02
permanent um Regular presence because they run the green team right out of
13:07
this so that's that directly benefits uh Beacon teens pre-teens and um and they
13:14
use the
13:21
facility any other comments on this [Music] one okay the one comment I wanted to
13:27
make we need a new aerial shot of the rec center because there was no Pavilion
13:33
there oh
13:39
okay all right and then the last one is just an update on uh our Adu
13:46
application yes I I just wanted to let you know that we have partnered with Hudson River housing which is the lead
13:52
on the Grant and seven other municipalities in the county the towns of Amenia Northeast Pine PL
13:59
town of pipy Stanford Unionville and the village of Reinbeck um Hudson River
14:05
housing has applied for $6 million under the governor's $85 million initiative to
14:11
um help low and moderate income homeowners uh develop accessory D
14:17
dwelling units in their homes um this would be for approximately 45 units
14:24
between the eight municipalities it's a 2-year Grant and it can provide up to
14:30
$125,000 per homeowner uh that's to help with architectural fees permitting fees
14:36
uh construction and um uh and legal fees
14:42
the um typically that they think that should cover about 70% of the cost of
14:47
adding these depending on how they're done and it would be for for garage conversions for Standalone adus or for
14:55
things like basement apartments um and um we're we're excited we hope they
15:01
award this and then the city would basically just help to get the information out Hudson River housing
15:07
would administrate it and they would get an administrative fee that's quite small
15:12
they only propose 3.3% administrative fees and um and then they would do all
15:19
of the monitoring so there's a 10-year period that they would monitor um the people who would qualify for these or
15:26
any homeowner that makes 100 % of the Ami or less so it's a broad range of
15:32
people and um I think it' be a bit of a challenge to try to get all 45 in the county so um but I'm I'm hopeful that we
15:40
can do our share in Beacon I think so first of all this is really great news
15:45
I'm glad to see you know I know this is something that we talked about this grant program for the LMI folks and so I'm glad to see that we're able to
15:52
realize that but I think the next step for the council is to think about our
15:57
Adu probably process specifically I've heard very pointedly from people that
16:02
have tried to go through this process that it is very expensive and timec consuming and it would really be a shame
16:08
to me if this funding was um you know this grant funding was taken up by
16:14
paperwork as opposed to construction and so I would love for the council to think about how we can um alleviate some of
16:22
that burden while still making sure that we've got the right checks and balances um you know for example I think King
16:30
had some kind of preset parameters or plans and if you were within those plans
16:35
then it was a little bit of an easier process so I would love to have us um have a conversation so that people get
16:41
the full benefit of this Grant and and Natalie and I spoke about that before the meeting so I think she can help
16:48
explore the tools you have in your toolbox to do that would be great thank you um and Nick and I also talked about
16:53
it from the perspective of possibly waving certain fees yeah um so I'm going to leave that conversation to Natalie
17:00
but that that's a good beginning and we'll we'll just start yeah for sure
17:06
this seems like the right time for us to kind of think about the the policy we have behind this and as I said I just
17:12
think it would be a shame if somebody who is an LMI applicant got this Grant application and and just had to spend
17:18
tons of it on you know paperwork agree is this so this program is taking
17:23
applicants now or Hudson River housing is kind of as asking the state for and it's not yet open
17:29
they've applied so there was a notice of funding announcement and I think this is the second or third they put in an
17:35
application um it looked good because the state came back and said we want you to apply for more okay um so um
17:43
originally they were going to apply for 2 million they ended up applying for 6 million um and that was at the state's
17:49
request so our hope is that they're going to turn it around quickly because they want to generate new housing units
17:55
um and they probably need to get the money out the door cuz this started in the 2022 2023 New York state capital
18:02
budget yeah the reason why I asked the question is because I believe they might be coming before the city council for another reason next week and I wonder if
18:09
it's appropriate for them to at least touch on this program even if they're not yet fully approved and be able to
18:14
take applications yet so and I also appreciate it might be different people running the different things we're talking about but if there's a way to
18:21
combine those two that would be a great opportunity to get the word out in our community I'll let Mary Ling know who I
18:26
think is going to come next week great and then just to summarize what the governor's proposal is in this area is
18:34
uh there's two means testing for an accessory dwelling unit the state is willing to make funds available to
18:40
homeowners who are means tested meaning that you know they don't exceed a certain income because they don't need
18:46
the money um but if the homeowner is then qualified the funds are then used
18:53
to develop an accessory dwelling unit and as a result the rent the rents for
18:59
those units will be subject to um also a means testing and a limitation right and
19:06
so that's kind of the benefit the state's offering which is for those who need the funds to renovate their home
19:11
you can get those funds but if you do that's not the program at all no I'm
19:17
sorry corre actually has no mandatory income for the people living in the unit
19:23
unless applicant has proposed that and they have not okay so the homeowner has
19:29
no limitation of income the homeowner has the limitation so if the homeowner makes more than 100% of Ami they are not
19:37
eligible okay the the tenant it doesn't there's no means test ah okay sorry I
19:43
didn't realize that so the assumption that this is kind of naturally affordable naturally affordable got it
19:49
okay good thank you for correcting me on that so um uh that's what I just wanted to make
19:58
sure the public occurred okay thank you and we do I think our current laws prohibit short-term rentals in adus is
20:06
that correct believe the funding does as well yeah the funding is very clear that that would knock it right out of the
20:11
program great thank you right and we needed someone to administer which is why we went to Hudson River housing and
20:19
we were the first ones to you know talk to them and they beat the bushes and got some others it's great to hear about
20:25
other places that are also interested in this as well okay um that's that do you want to do
20:32
the quick update on the tip grant that you just applied for do you want to do that another time I can do a quick um we
20:37
just applied for a transportation Improvement program grant for beakman Street for a project called uh beakman
20:44
Street pedestrian and bicycle improvements um we have applied for 3 million of a $3.8 million project to put
20:54
new sidewalks on both sides of the street develop bike Lanes um and also resurface the street and do
21:01
drainage work much a lot like we're doing on Fishkill teller with the drainage um the the grant probably won't
21:10
be awarded till the summer so we'll have a better idea then and um we we had uh
21:16
strong support from we we had a letter from the CAC from cenic Hudson from Duchess tourism and assemblymen assembly
21:25
member Jacobson and Senator rollison so we're we're hopeful that we can get the money it's an 8020 split and it would
21:33
take us we we'd first do a design process then we' do construction so it's a multi-year
21:39
process all and this is for the section of beakman from the train station up to Main Street um yes okay great and by
21:49
train station you mean kind of roughly across from fer streeted okay up to then so it's just
21:54
over half a mile great thank you okay all right um that's that now let's go
22:01
back to the items at the top um and let's start with we've got two that are
22:06
zoning related one Fishkill Avenue specific and then the other one is I brought up the memo that Natalie did uh
22:13
last year mid year on um housing related uh zoning that we could do and we'll
22:18
start through those and the third one after that is a a priorities document if
22:25
we uh and I'm assuming we'll have a rich discussion on the first two weeks we may not get to the third if we don't I I'll
22:30
tell you how to read it and then we'll pick it up the next time all right and so on Fishkill Avenue Concepts
22:39
um I did one thing before you start or you can start and then I just want to add what was in the comprehensive plan
22:46
on Route 52 because that I wanted to make sure the council heard and we didn't ask you to do that so I just
22:51
looked it up myself and as you know it's not a lot but I just want to make sure we cover it so I have the material here
22:57
did you want to start with that or do you want me to um is that okay yeah that's okay yeah so in our 2017
23:03
comprehensive plan which always should be our starting point a roote 52 does not have a lot of of stuff in there uh
23:10
on page 67 and again I can read the entire thing uh it says Route 52 it says
23:16
maintain existing retail and service mix um while improving the character of the
23:21
area through pedestrian amenities such as sidewalk Street trees improved architectural design and then it has a
23:28
couple of steps after that which is require Property Owners uh and I'm summarizing and skipping some phrases to
23:34
provide sidewalk Street trees improved architectural design during site plan review and then the other one is explore
23:40
funding opportunities uh to provide streetscape amenities including sidewalk trees benches sheltered bus stops bike
23:47
racks information kiosks and that's kind of the extent of it um there was uh
23:54
recommended zoning changes in the 2017 comp plan most of which we've done there
23:59
were two that kind of vaguely related to this um one was in growville Mills to
24:05
which was uh a light industrial Zone to make that Fishkill Creek development what we actually did was we made the
24:12
section where the brick houses are we made that I think R15 and then we made
24:18
the section behind it Fishkill Creek development and then the other thing um
24:24
that was related to it was a proposal to a remove High heavy industry the hi
24:31
zoning which we have done except for the railroad tracks that's kind of The Only Exception there so I just wanted to
24:38
provide that backdrop of what's there and then I'll turn over to NY yeah um and we also have JC Calderon who is the
24:44
chair of the fishal Avenue committee so I can start JC and then Orient and we can jump in together um so yes the the
24:52
the committee we actually did start with reviewing the comprehensive plan and did note that the language was a little lighten there in terms of guidance and
24:58
there has been discussion that if some of the zoning recommendations uh move forward you know it's very light on
25:04
language with housing and things like that so we do recommend that there may potentially be updates to the comprehensive plan because your code
25:10
should always be in alignment with that right so um the committee is aware of that and they would be recommending language for the comp plan um if they
25:18
felt that some of their recommendations were not um explicitly outlined in the comp plan so I'll I'll just kind of
25:25
Orient us um to the letter there are um the mayor separ there are four zoning
25:30
specific recommendations that we can go through um I just want to you know in the top paragraph the committee is
25:37
thinking about a broad range of zoning and non- Zoning recommendations and the committee members felt that that was
25:43
really important to kind of note that that there's a wide range of things this is a very kind of focused area um that
25:48
you're seeing here in this memo so they are looking at things like um access points to the Future rail trail uh
25:55
connecting to modan Road housing both affordable and market rate appropriateness of ground floor
26:01
residential uses along the corridor um complete streets designs that include options like continuous sidewalks bike
26:08
Lanes additional Landscaping bio retention for storm water management um and and on street parking within the
26:15
city's rideway and they're also looking at things like building Heights um and protection of public Scenic few sheds
26:21
amongst other things so I kind of wanted to orient the committee really felt it was important to show this full breadth
26:26
of things that we're looking at and then the other thing that I will say in terms of orienting for the zoning and land use
26:33
recommendations um the committee felt that in general the corridor does have zoning districts which facilitate a wide
26:38
range of uses um but the committee is crafting kind of a longer term vision for the corridor which promotes smart
26:45
growth practices pedestrian scale um housing and higher quality design as was
26:51
kind of referenced in the comp plan and so with that vision in mind that's where these these zoning recommendations are
26:57
stemming from and there are four um individual recommendations each one as you go
27:03
through the memo has kind of a short justification for why that's being considered as well as the potential
27:09
recommendation for language um so I'll just run through those quickly and cut
27:14
me off if you want to jump in at all um recommendation one is uh with regards to stealth storage facilities um so while
27:23
the committee recognizes that there's a need um on some level for this use and there actually is an existing self storage facility um in in The Lofts in
27:31
an existing structure um the committee feels that due to the low number of employment opportunities that these uh
27:38
businesses provide as well as kind of the documented lack of contributions that they provide for creating the
27:45
vibrant Corridor that is at the heart of the vision uh for this area the committee does recommend that self-
27:50
storage businesses um they would have to be separated from wholesale um other warehousing and things like that and
27:56
that they be prohibited in the corridor um on a similar thread there so three of
28:02
these have to do with use and then one of them has to do with kind of design uh placement uh so the second
28:07
recommendation um the committee has similar concerns regarding drive-through components uh so these uses typically
28:13
focus on autoc Centric design and and are considered detrimental to pedestrian safety um they often create con
28:20
congested kind of traffic patterns with cars entering and exiting at various angles which lead to increased risk of
28:27
collision with with pedestrians um so with the evolution of
28:32
the corridor kind of keeping in mind that we're looking at this pedestrian scale Vision uh the committee recommends
28:37
that drive-through facilities Standalone or used in connection with other uses be expressly prohibited uh within all the
28:43
districts along the corridor right now in the city of Beacon they are only discussed really in the Main Street
28:49
Corridor in the Main Street zoning District as being prohibited and it's kind of the code is silent elsewhere
28:55
it's not you know either expressly permitted or prohibited and so the committee felt that that should be made
29:02
clear I'm going to skip three and go to four because that also has to do with use and we'll go back to three so
29:07
recommendation four um the committee has similar concerns as those noted in recommendations one and two with regards
29:13
to other autoed use Auto oriented uses um gas filling stations Car Wash vehicle
29:19
sales um Auto Body and repair uh so the committee feels that the existing Active
29:25
Auto oriented uses within the corridor should be permitted to remain under the code AS existing non-conforming uses
29:31
however uh the change to zoning a change to the zoning uh should prohibit these uses so that they can be phased out over
29:38
time um and then the jumping back up to recommendation three this one has to do with uh front yard setbacks and the
29:45
location of parking um so the committee looked a lot at the application that
29:51
went through the planning board a few years ago for 397 fishco Avenue which kind of has the building up to the up to
29:56
the sidewalk which is Landscaping in front of it parking is located behind um they felt that that was a really
30:02
successful design and that that starts to create The Pedestrian scale and narrow kind of you know right now we
30:08
have a lot of existing buildings set back behind kind of open parking areas
30:13
um so the committee um uh they feel like this the building
30:19
sitting sitting back behind expanses of asphalt and parking detracts from the walkability and the Vitality of the
30:24
corridor disrupting the street wall and providing uh prioritizing vehicle access over pedestrian access so the committee
30:32
recommends um reducing the minimum front yard setback within the GB district from 15 to 10 um and that the you add
30:40
language to require that parking uh be put behind and this language exists elsewhere in the code so what's
30:45
recommended is that all parking shall be located behind underneath or to the side of a building if to the side parking
30:51
shall be screened uh by a low wall hedge or other Landscaping to kind of maintain the continuity of the street okay the
30:58
one other thing I will say before I pass this over to JC to add any other bits is
31:05
um this was not a unanimous decision um there it was almost unanimous by the by
31:10
the committee but there were members of the committee um who are business owners who felt that uh the prohibition of uses
31:17
could be detrimental to existing businesses um and Property Owners on the corridor and the planning board also
31:23
voiced some concern about that about where else would these uses if you know outright rightly prohibited where else
31:29
would they be permitted in the city of Beacon and that that should be considered further so I did just want to
31:34
note th those pieces of um of kind of dissent and not that we're a legal
31:39
briefing here but dissent from the opinion um and then also the committee is very focused on um we still want to
31:47
kind of vet these with the public these recommendations so these are initial priority recommendations right now but
31:54
the committee is in the process and JC can talk a little bit more about this about organiz ing um we did a lot of
31:59
public engagement during the summer kind of as popups and things like that but they want to we want to do another engagement to specifically kind of talk
32:06
about these recommendations um with the public and get their feedback further because some of them are pretty
32:11
significant changes should we hold questions or should we jump into JC yeah happy to take some questions
32:19
well just I'm curious about the discussion that was had about how the the det detrimental nature of that decision if we're having any exclusions
32:25
for the existing businesses was there a discussion about why that would be detrimental to those businesses um I think the general
32:32
conversation is about uh what the market is currently kind of providing as
32:37
potential tenants for these spaces right now and it's you know it's in a transition period right this area is
32:43
very Auto oriented right now um and has been historically so I think the conversation was that um you would it
32:51
could potentially preclude some of these businesses from being occupied in the short term that I I don't know if you felt
32:59
like there was another justification made but I think that was because they'd have to vacate and come back well what's
33:05
what's the question Jeff about why the why the decisions if there was zoning decisions to exclude certain types of
33:11
business that are already there Car Wash fueling station why would it be detrimental if this zoning change was
33:18
made to existing businesses you mean why why some people in the committee felt
33:23
that both was discussion was there was there evidence from other locations was something similar happened and it did
33:28
prove detrimental to those businesses I'm really curious uh well um my my sense is that
33:36
the um the the center you know felt that uh we hadn't really reached out to
33:41
enough businesses to get their sense of um their point of view uh although we've
33:46
welcomed everyone publicly for months now and anybody can you know come to
33:51
read that reach out to us but I think the uh part of the equation might be
33:56
that um some people have different understanding of how zoning works and there might be a perception that things happen maybe
34:03
sooner than than it than it would in other words some people you know didn't understand that existing businesses um
34:10
would be grandfathered in and wouldn't be necessarily affected by any zoning um update so there's there's in part
34:17
perhaps misunderstanding not necessarily by this Committee Member but just by people in general there's a a kind of um
34:24
I think there's more um communication has to be done as to to the implications of a zonian update and I'll just add one
34:31
thing I think just trying to put myself in their shoes I think there's a thought that these are viable business options
34:37
that provide services to members of the community and they have to be located somewhere and that this may be one of
34:44
the last corridors in the city that allows some of these uses and so by changing this zoning and prohibiting
34:50
them they're they're left to they cannot they could continue to operate right if
34:55
you're an existing business you can continue to operate um but that we would remove the opportunity for new businesses like this
35:02
to come in which I think some would argue serve purposes for the community many people own a car that needs to you
35:08
know that needs repair at some point so I think just trying to put myself I appreciate it and just a clarification
35:14
is because as described in the recommendation they would be grandfathered in so it could be an advantage if no other businesses no
35:20
other competition was allowed so I just I'm really just interested to hear more about how this would be detrimental to
35:26
affect our decision so yeah the you know I listened into some of the conversations my impression is you and
35:32
correct me if I'm wrong but I think you would have gotten consensus if the changes were more gradual or phased in
35:39
as opposed to we'll go we'll jump to what we think The Pedestrian friendly solution will be because that would say
35:47
um you know you might do instead of Auto oriented you might kind of phase them
35:53
out over time as opposed to saying tomorrow they're gone because the area is not terribly pedestrian oriented at
36:00
the moment isn't going to be for some period of time and so jumping to the solution as opposed to getting there
36:06
gradually I think would have gotten others on board but the proposal the current proposal of grandfathering those
36:14
changes in does that not accomplish what you just said well that that you have to do regardless yeah I mean they essentially it
36:20
it if we were to say this is no longer permitted in this Zone it's not like you
36:25
can just show up tomorrow and kick them out of their business like it just becomes a a non-conforming use so I
36:32
don't really um that you know appreciate the perspective obviously any change
36:37
that we make has to have a public hearing and they're certainly welcome to voice any concerns at that point in time
36:43
um I just don't see that as something that um I don't know is overly concerning to me at the moment um
36:50
especially as what we're looking at and JC I want to thank you and the committee
36:55
specifically um after you came here at the end of the year you know the council agreed that we would really like to see
37:02
some very tactical suggestions and I appreciate the work that went into getting these in front of us so thank
37:08
you very much I also really see this as an opportunity for us to actually allow
37:14
the committee to continue their work and give us an opportunity to Envision a
37:19
more pedestrian friendly better design kind of corridor so I see this as a very important mid-step that enables that
37:26
Future Vision to actually come to life and I think in looking at this proposal
37:32
two things are really incredibly simple to me and I feel very non-controversial about them is recommendation one and two
37:40
um and those seem like really straightforward changes the the language in here is um I'm perfectly comfortable
37:46
with and I would be very happy to move those forward um in terms of our process
37:52
to make changes and as I have stated multiple times I would like to do that
37:59
expeditiously I'd like a further clarification on the grandfathering and existing
38:04
non-conforming um like say um Healey closed and they have since rented it to
38:11
carvana that would be allowed it would the same owner wouldn't have to continue on if a gas station could sell the right
38:19
to operate a gas station there so it doesn't preclude those continuing on it
38:24
just doesn't allow further uses like correct allow New Uses to come within
38:30
the district but the existing ones can continue to be operated they can sell to a new owner and within reason they can
38:36
also do some limited expansions or modifications to their building for parum buildings it yeah they would be
38:41
able to do some expansion they would there's always that question with nonconforming uses are they expanding the use it's a fact intensive one but it
38:49
prohibits any New Uses coming in it allows the existing ones to continue both thank you so I always thought I had
38:58
a loud voice thank you though so the non-conforming prohibits New Uses from being established it allows the existing
39:05
ones to continue on that property it allows it to be sold and transferred to a new owner and it also um if it's
39:12
discontinued I think in Beacon it's for 6 months or more then it ceases to continue so if you had a gas station and
39:19
they stopped for 6 months and they want to recontinue in the seventh month they wouldn't be permitted to reestablish that use and there are abilities to make
39:26
minor modification or changes because the law recognizes that you can modernize you don't have to go stale so
39:33
if there's now a requirement to have an electric charging station at a gas station you could put the electric
39:38
charging station in I think I think the distinction is that you're not allowed to increase the non-conformity but you
39:45
are allowed to do something that would um change the building but as long as it's not deemed as increasing the
39:51
nonconform right the intensity of the use so just to follow George's question how does that six
39:58
months work and I'll give you an example um we've got we had a two family on
40:04
Church Street uh in an R1 that had a fire and as a result um how much time do
40:12
they have to rebuild the house before the non-conforming use has to go away
40:17
you said 6 months is it 6 months from what to what so I'll pull the code up because it varies from municipality to
40:23
municipality so I don't want to misspeak but in some situations if the non-conforming use is destroyed
40:32
by a fire you cannot recontinue it if you make a modification that is 50% or more you cannot continue it so I'd have
40:38
to look at Beacon specific I was just saying that if you discontinue it like
40:43
changing you don't have a buyer so you go out of business for seven months you could not pick up the use but if there's
40:49
a change to the business in that the building is completely torn um on fire
40:54
and burned down then you can't reestablish that use yeah so I hear at least from my thinking a tradeoff which
41:00
is if we're going to um enact zoning that's where we're wanting to get to
41:05
over 10 or 20 years now I would like that 6month or the non-conforming use
41:13
opened up to allow um some flexibility in there if we make it tight then I
41:19
don't want the changes for a while if we loosen it up and say you know you get a year to lose a non-conforming use I get
41:26
a lot more comfortable saying okay let's go with the zoning that's where we want to get to in 20 years even though we're
41:32
not there right now right so that that that's the trade-off I see on that
41:38
one well I am definitely in favor of uh the recommendation
41:43
two um for numerous reasons especially when you consider the emissions that a
41:49
drive-thru causes and that it's you know looking in the future we're going to
41:56
have a real Trail and to have emissions happening right where people are walking
42:01
in nature um seems to go against itself the traffic issue is another um
42:08
consideration and it's clear that these Parcels can't handle drive-throughs um in listening to what's
42:16
happening right now and as I just want and as for the
42:22
Autos I mean I'm somewhat sensitive to it cuz there are at least 18 Parcels in
42:28
this area right now that either in the past two years have had um Auto related
42:35
or currently are in the business with auto related so I feel the majority have
42:41
been autoc Centric that I think it does have to be sensitive and I could agree with Lee on looking at that's a future
42:50
but not right now to say that yeah I mean my point continues to be that I
42:56
think that we are quickly losing our window to take advantage of the the
43:03
wonderful things that the committee is recommending when you ran through some of the long-term um Visions for this they're
43:10
they're wonderful I think that would be such a positive for our community and um
43:16
if we do not take some quick action to tactically prevent some uses that we
43:22
know do not align to that Vision then what's the point of having the vision might as well just stop what you're
43:28
doing well I only hear that in one very specific one the only one that I'm hearing is uh a drive-thru I'm not
43:36
hearing anything else as sort of occurring in the moment that's going to like somehow preclude us from doing
43:42
something I'd also be happy to just move recommendation to forward I have no problem with that I I think the I think
43:48
the recommendation of getting rid of Self Storage is a good one because of the market behind people kind of
43:55
gobbling up these parcels and making them into Self Storage I can see that being um something that somebody wants
44:01
to do and and the points made here are very valid it's it's a low number of employment um there's not a lot of
44:08
really you know it does not contribute to the vibrant Corridor that's being envisioned here so no problem with
44:14
either but I would certainly prioritize recommendation too and I get I guess the question is can we do that and how do we
44:21
do that how do we put this here's what I go ahead I was going to say procedurally so our office would
44:27
prepare a draft local law you can consider at a workshop meeting once you've determined it's where you want it to be we would then schedule a public
44:34
hearing it would be referred to the planning board for a report and recommendation as well as to the County
44:39
planning board for a report and recommendation after you receive their report you would then schedule a public hearing close it and then deliberate and
44:46
then vote on it and when is the next um planning board in County review cycle
44:52
they generally do it within 30 days okay and we can get it on to the next planum Bo after you introduce it you know and if
44:59
you recall why we asked the committee to come up with um some recommendations in
45:05
the short term that they were comfortable with was this issue of timing right so I think you know it's up
45:10
to us to say okay we can push one of these forward we can push all of them forward but I think if we're thinking we
45:17
want to be expeditious pick what we want to be expeditious about and break it into Parts I think that's that that
45:23
should work it's perfectly fine to do it in pieces right yeah that's kind of why I was focusing on one and two I mean the
45:29
language in here is very straightforward I don't know that it needs much more discussion than what
45:36
we're seeing in front of us in order to pass something on as a memo to the planning board in the
45:41
county I would agree with recommendation one also I was thinking that was the autoc Centric one oh okay that's the
45:48
Self Storage I apologize no all good well I didn't coverage one two and four uh myself um if possible also happy with
45:55
that and you know we I guess it's a it's a race in a way because as we talked about last meeting it was about how
46:02
invested the the developer is and yeah the point is is we have to get this done
46:07
before ground is broken so we have to right so just to clarify that point any
46:13
um we spoke about non-conforming uses those are existing uses any New Uses
46:19
would have to comply with zoning at the time that they um I'm sorry let me
46:24
straight it different way they don't have vested rights to the existing zoning until they have if you will
46:29
poured the foundation and something substantial has come out of the ground yeah yeah and I mean that's why I'm kind
46:35
of pushing on these aspects a little bit because they they seem very straightforward I I don't know that they
46:42
require a ton of workshopping and like again my primary concern is making sure that the the
46:48
long-term Vision that the Fishkill Avenue committee and I believe many members of this Council share that that
46:54
overall vision is something that we can actually do yeah I I would urge caution
47:00
on the fourth one the auto oriented there's a number of uses there and I
47:06
don't want to be in the situation where we've legislated away stuff and we end
47:11
up with empty lots for a period of time during our transition period it seems to me that our our urgency is not around
47:20
that as as much as item two uh I'm not worried about self storage because
47:25
nobody in their right mind would put in Self Storage on land that valuable but I don't have any problem with that
47:32
restriction so I I would say I'm comfortable moving forward quickly on one and two but I would slow us down and
47:40
ask this that we be deliberative on the fourth one I I tend to agree with that mainly
47:46
because I want the Public's input on number four um however I think I can see the efficiency that if there was a
47:53
proposal came before that we felt there was a need like there is with some things with number two that we might
47:58
feel a difference but I'm okay with it being a little less efficient in the name of giving people more time to
48:04
discuss and figure out like we've talked about here I also had a question about if we wanted to move forward with this
48:09
which it seems like we have enough people who do I believe the zoning in Fishkill also exists in other parts of
48:17
the city I think it's General business if I'm understanding correctly and so I just wanted to make sure that we're
48:23
clear about in this memo to are we because we're not yet and there are several different there's more than one
48:29
type of zoning in the area that the fish cab committee so are we do we need to move forward with with creating a zoning
48:35
that is unique to this Corridor or is there a way to to deal with the existing zoning make the changes without then
48:41
having an unintended consequence with other areas of the city that have that zoning that we're not intending to limit
48:48
right now um I had the same question as Molly and just to add on to that I believe Natalie you referenced this um
48:55
that um you were suggesting potentially separating wholesale or and storage um
49:01
as uses I'm referencing our um use table um as well as it seems adding um
49:08
drive-throughs as a distinct use in our use table so that we can explicitly ban
49:15
it yeah I think that's one way to do it is to add right Self Storage will become
49:20
its own separate use because right now it's lumped in with wholesale drive-thru is not listed as a use or an accessory
49:25
use it's only referenced within the text of the CMS District so I think
49:31
there's you know there's multiple ways that the council could decide to do that I think adding drive-throughs as an accessory use to the table is probably
49:37
cleanest and then you can decide what districts that's included in or not
49:42
um to your larger question Molly yeah there's a there's a number of zoning districts that exist in this Corridor
49:50
and unfortunately the council we've been looking at one larger zoning District or potentially tweaks I think the fact
49:56
fastest way is tweaks to existing owning districts rather than trying to that's a map change and and I don't think the
50:02
boundaries have really been drawn or agreed upon by the by the committee quite yet on that
50:09
um but I I think that's that's I I would agree with that approach and I think it's straightforward right we amend the
50:15
existing zones to reflect the those that are shortterm that we want to do quickly
50:20
and then when we're ready and you've got a full set of recommendations that will include whether to create a separate
50:26
Zone or to further adjust the existing zones in that area and I'm I think
50:32
that's okay either way the one other area of GB is is along um Leonard Street
50:38
Leonard Street there's one other area of GB that's what I was going to mention that like in terms of the uses that
50:44
we're talking about I don't I don't think there's anywhere in the city where I'm like yes that is an amazing place
50:50
for Self Storage um you know so I don't really I I don't have a concern with it
50:57
bleeding into other districts and I I do think that this council is going to
51:02
spend a lot of time on Fishkill Avenue in general as we should and so like I I
51:08
don't know I I just don't believe that zoning is ever written in no legislation is written in concrete like these are
51:14
all things that we should revisit but I encourage us to take a very like tactical perspective on what's in front
51:21
of us now and and how we feel about that so sorry just had a quick had a
51:28
quick for Nick like if we were to do a local law uh with the local law then
51:33
because I think I think our Zone in general overlaps for the districts um hi
51:38
and Li and GB so with the local law then I just identify the new um language and
51:47
and address the the four districts that it affects only the four districts correct I mean well would it address the
51:53
districts which we want to I thought it was in the fishco Avenue along GB are we also talking along the
51:59
hi so this is sort of one of the reasons why I would say we would bring it back for another workshop on the local law is
52:05
to make sure we have Clarity and also that when Natalie and I sit down we think about the unintended consequences
52:10
and something we may have overlooked but I I don't think it's a big lift at the end of the day to bring this back for a with a local law yeah I I think our
52:16
first step is to get a sense of where Council wants to head generally and then the next step would be put a proposal
52:23
together we'll start to look at I don't think we're trying to we have have time we don't have to rush and I think it's
52:28
important that we be deliberative on this so I will just say recommendation one and two those were from the
52:35
committee um intended to be applied to all zoning districts along the corridor that's the language in there right that
52:40
would be amending the table basically right yes right that's pretty straightforward M could we still do the
52:46
memo to the planning board in the county without what what level of specificity would we need before we're able to bring
52:53
them in I didn't want to interrupt previously but it's not a it's not a memo it's local law we need to introduce and prepare of a local law and it's a
52:59
local law that they comment on under the law yeah I think we can bring that to you in the next work session it's not uh
53:06
give you a draft local law to consider well again if we if we keep it narrow it gets easier to do right right so great
53:14
so that would be on the 10th and then I think the planning board has their meeting the next day but it sounds like
53:20
it might then wait depend till the till the March meeting that they would have time to review it oh I would defer to
53:26
the who are part of the planning board what works best if we I guess we wouldn't have passed it or do we have to
53:32
then vote on sending it to the planning board or or come out of Workshop you do yes I mean it automatically goes as a
53:37
matter of law you if you introduce the law your code says zoning has to be sent to the plane board so you're not voting on sending it automatically goes there
53:44
but generally it's not sent to them until you've introduced it right and introducing is a thing we do at our
53:50
formal when you schedu a hearing right and then Nick I'd also like you to consider do we need to say say something
53:56
about the comprehensive plan um I know it didn't say much but it was basically saying we're eliminating uses on Main
54:03
Street and we're expecting to be they can be in other parts of the city we're now starting to say they shouldn't be in
54:09
other parts of the city either so would you just consider if we need to do anything there yes yep thank you are we
54:17
able to you know just seeing the direction that this is heading in and the the way I I think the council is
54:24
aligned and trying to move this forward quickly um is there a way to like I don't know
54:30
give the planning board a heads up and ask them very nicely to please look at this in the February meeting if we can
54:35
introduce the local law instead of waiting until March we have done that in the past where we've introduced something we've given them a heads up
54:41
and then it's once it's received once it's introduced on the 10th they then amend their agenda and can consider it
54:46
on the 11th at times they've been able to work it in at other times they've said it requires to meeting but at least they've started the discussion okay and
54:53
again they control their agenda so they can decide if they wish to add it or not there is a public hearing scheduled for
54:59
property over that way for an applicant um for the February meeting
55:04
then I then I don't I would really want not want to wait until March I understand they control the agenda but
55:12
um I would love for us to encourage them very nicely yeah I don't I don't think it would be that hard for them there
55:18
there was a a meeting where the fish kill Avenue folks came to the planning board there was a discussion this m
55:24
right so they're familiar with the topic and so it shouldn't be hard for them to weigh in they kind of weighed in then as well right so I think we just be getting
55:30
that to the people that have applications pending with the planning board that does include um
55:36
drive-throughs I think this is a good opportunity maybe hopefully they're paying attention yeah as well
55:41
yeah so I I have a a prediction and a data point uh prediction um the Self
55:48
Storage that is already in uh existence along that Corridor um will get sold and
55:54
built into housing in the next Dozen Years um simply because it's far
56:00
more valuable uh as long as the building can be converted that's the prediction uh and then on drive-throughs I just
56:06
have this incidental data point which was um I was um with the high school seniors in the participation in
56:13
government course uh earlier I guess last fall and I asked them um the group
56:19
of seniors what they thought of a Dunkin Donuts uh with a drive-thru on Route 52
56:24
um that was about 90 % positive uh now I think the primary reason was not the
56:31
drive-thru uh maybe some of them have their licenses but I think part of it was um something affordable uh and I
56:38
think that's sorry yeah I'm just saying I think that's a consideration um it's just a data point I don't think it
56:44
Alters what we're doing just I was in that meeting too and my recollection was the emphasis was on the food not not at
56:50
all the drive-through aspect I don't recall the drive-through part coming up at all I think the ones that had licenses would have been excited to both
56:56
get cheap food and drive to do it well they'll be happy to drive wherever when you have a license at that age yeah but
57:02
I think it's the cheap food and just one clarification on the scheduling little wrinkle so your next meeting on the
57:07
third is actually your agenda meeting of items coming out of this the 10th is the workshop and the 18th is the actual
57:13
meeting when you would vote to refer it to the planning board and schedule the public hearing so the timing doesn't
57:19
work with respect to having this considered at the planning board's February 11th meeting but again no one
57:25
gains any vested rights or anything and certainly they're aware of this board's
57:30
discussion does the planning board so they voted on a public hearing for an
57:37
applicant that might be impacted by this potentially does the planning board have
57:43
discretion to ask the applicant to reschedule the public hearing or now that they've voted on it as long as the
57:49
applicant wants to move forward they need to honor that correct they've scattered it so again I don't want to
57:54
speak to the planning board's process but once a public hearing is scheduled it's being noticed and the planning
58:00
board if they were to adjourn it it'd have to have a reason to do so and pending legislation wouldn't be AAL I
58:06
know they've rescheduled in the past but normally it's because the applicant wasn't ready and requested that okay all
58:11
right thank you I mean they have they have they can keep the public hearing open so again
58:17
it's two separate it's two separate processes so I wouldn't want this legislation to influence that process
58:23
yeah okay all right we are going to have a public
58:30
um feedback session at um the 15th right it was scheduled for the 15th of
58:36
February but we've rescheduled it due to the holiday so uh right now industrial Arts has made their space available to
58:42
us for March 8th at uh 1:30 to 4:30 and that's the date as of this moment um so
58:50
that will be Saturday March 8th and we'll have a uh open to the public we
58:56
hope all of you can attend and um we will have a presentation followed by
59:02
sort of Workshop discussions table table discussions with whoever wants to be
59:09
there we're going to divide up categories maybe into four areas and have people have conversation and then
59:16
we'll have a summary at the End by someone representing the group but that's sort of the goal right now March
59:22
8th that sounds great okay March 8th from 1:30 to 4 we're a flyer for it so I can make sure
59:28
to circulate the F to the council so everybody has that yeah that's wonderful I I feel like there's a lot of interest
59:34
so I hope that a lot of people turn out and of course um this decision-making body has multiple opportunities for
59:41
public input um especially as any potential changes we talked about today
59:46
go through the process we we obviously would have a public hearing and and other opportunities
59:51
so I hope we hear from people yeah and JC to clarify on Mar March 8th you're
59:56
going to be presenting a number of recommendations Beyond these four that were in this memo yeah we'll be touching
1:00:03
on them we're trying to um touch on them as as sort of um conceptual as light as
1:00:09
possible because this will be really our first major public uh event um and have
1:00:16
and then we'll have like to have enough time to have people respond to that but
1:00:21
um yes so we'll have we'll have a it it'll be a sort of an elaboration of
1:00:27
what we shared in November great aome lots to dig into so
1:00:34
it sounded like we have uh a path forward are we okay with uh asking Nick
1:00:40
to draft on the first two items to consider the six-month issue to consider
1:00:47
whether anything in the comp plan needs to go with it and to come back to us with something and you know even if
1:00:53
you're not 100% there bring back the issue on those items yes we're prepared on our side
1:00:59
that's our understanding yes okay everybody good with that yes I just wanted to add one more thing after we're
1:01:07
agreed on the one and two I just wanted to make a comment on the recommendation
1:01:12
three um while I don't have a problem with changing the front yard setback you
1:01:19
know 2 10 ft the parking in the rear because some of these um the depths of
1:01:25
some of these properties are less than 100 ft um that that should be considered
1:01:32
for parking in the back really would not be possible I don't think yeah I'm I'm
1:01:38
glad you mention it's bumping up to residential at that point so maybe if that can be thought of well I think the
1:01:44
the idea is parking if parking can fit on the site not to place it in the front so parking can fit on the site and
1:01:50
you're building a new building and there's even space for it the parking is either going to be in front of the building or behind it and I think
1:01:55
recommendation is if you have space on site to put parking it should be behind or to the side rather than between the
1:02:01
building and the street face right and the side with camouflage kind of thing with some kind of yeah buffer of that so
1:02:07
there are there are some shallow Lots where they're going to have a hard time fitting parking on there in general I think uh but the idea is that it
1:02:14
shouldn't be between the building and the street yeah on on the West Side um
1:02:19
by me uh they're the lots are typically about 85 ft deep I believe on the other
1:02:25
side they over 100 I think maybe 125 yeah so so it is a difference and so we
1:02:31
we'll keep that in mind right now I believe both sides are allowed to be about uh required to be 15 ft um from
1:02:38
the spot line so by making them 10 um it's it's giving people more space to
1:02:45
park in the back but to your point you know
1:02:51
um they're not the same so we'll we'll keep that in mind yeah yeah I'm glad glad you brought that up because I I
1:02:57
think the general concept of the way you've described the setback makes sense um I think the the distinction between
1:03:05
the thinness of the northwest side Lots versus the southeast side Lots may
1:03:10
affect what you do it may affect um what you put where it may affect height um it
1:03:17
may affect you know how long something can be um and you might it might you
1:03:22
know I think it's perfectly fine to say I got different 's on this side of the street than the other side of the street
1:03:28
um so I just encourage that but I think this is you're going the right direction with that third one and I would just
1:03:34
encourage you to keep going in that direction it it's not timely for this group so I don't think we need to worry
1:03:40
about it so you should consider it as a package and you know don't be concerned to put all the pieces
1:03:46
together um I also wanted to flag something that I saw in the introduction
1:03:52
I'm I'm glad that we've identified recommendation 2 um as our top priority
1:03:57
um and one as well um but I was surprised to see that on street parking
1:04:03
uh was in within the city's right of way was one of the items under consideration
1:04:10
and I just wanted to vocalize from my perspective from what I've heard that I would certainly prioritize sidewalks and
1:04:17
bike Lanes ahead of any on street parking I certainly see the potential need for strategic Ada parking
1:04:24
particularly around access points potential for bus pull-offs or a loading zone but um anything that's prioritizing
1:04:31
personal vehicle use parking um I I don't see fitting into my understanding
1:04:36
so far of the vision so where where go ahead we're
1:04:42
considering um you know the the corridor is about a mile long and we've been
1:04:47
studying all the varieties throughout it and they they change right there's places where it's thinner th there's
1:04:54
different um envir Ms like in M Street right where you have the MTA properties
1:05:00
right up against the Avenue and we the public or the city would potentially have about 100 ft if the MTA
1:05:07
relinquished it for public space and in that CL in that location the bike Lanes
1:05:14
um on the rail trail are the most close to that um to that part of Fishkill
1:05:20
Avenue so that for for example that area could be an area where have bike uh bus
1:05:26
stops or some on street parking because if that open area does become a park
1:05:32
which we hope or some kind of open space which right now I'm talking about from Fishkill to to where the ashphalt of of
1:05:41
uh the groveville um parking is that's not owned by the groveville developer right that owner that's owned by the MTA
1:05:48
which would then hopefully become under the city's use so that public space you
1:05:54
know could be um rather than make that into a parking lot it could could be
1:05:59
left as an open space and potentially some bus stopping or some parking in that area but in general we're trying to
1:06:06
see where bike Lanes would be most urgent and most effective yeah the I'm
1:06:12
sorry go ahead I was just going to add so I think the priority is pedestrian right when you're thinking about complete streets pedestrian comes first
1:06:18
right because you're always a pedestrian whether you're getting out of a car getting off a bike at some point in your journey you are going to be a pedestrian
1:06:25
and so that's where on street parking comes is that it's actually been shown as a very effective traffic calming
1:06:30
measure and a buffer for sidewalks and pedestrians right so I hear you when we're talking about like non-motorized
1:06:36
access and and pedestrian safety the idea of thinking about cars in that can
1:06:42
seem a little bit incon like at at odds but the truth is folks will still be
1:06:48
using vehicles to get to this Corridor right the idea is to have them get out of their vehicles and walk the corridor
1:06:53
and on street parking has been shown to be not only it Narrows your um your vision it causes kind of friction on the
1:07:00
on the side so it slows traffic that way but also provides a physical barrier
1:07:05
which makes people feel more comfortable walking on and I can imagine that in certain locations and and that's what I
1:07:11
I'm getting at it sort of prioritizing who that parking is for um but if we're
1:07:16
in a narrow area and there's a choice between um parking for personal vehicles
1:07:22
and a bike lane um I think that a bike lane would need to be continuous and needs to be prioritized but a few spot
1:07:29
parking spaces where there is space um I like the Grove um the spot that um JC
1:07:36
was describing I can see how that would make sense and then to the same point Landscaping can be used in the same way
1:07:42
right kind of with with with trees and things like that Landscaping can also be used as a buffer and I agree um the
1:07:48
ability to provide a continuous bike lane so you don't have bike Lanes ending somewhere or not connecting uh smoothly
1:07:55
is a priority in in in bike infrastructure yeah the um I had a
1:08:00
similar view to where Palomo went and I heard when I heard both of you say it's
1:08:05
how you slow this the cars down I was like oh I get it and I I've seen you
1:08:10
know JC you and I talked and it's like certain sections it would make some sense because it would because there's
1:08:16
no way to slow Route 52 down we put up you know here's your speed it doesn't work right it works it works to what
1:08:23
point it works it compared to W cut I mean it's by far our fastest one so I I just like the concept and again I'm
1:08:30
going to leave it to you all because you're going to put the package together you're going to do the prioritization I get it but I I hear how that work can
1:08:37
fit and my understanding of that traffic calming is that actually that varability that sometimes there's parking sometimes
1:08:44
there's a tree is also helpful um it makes people pay more attention so what's on the sides of you as you're
1:08:49
driving isn't just a blur yeah I mean the one thing that I was thinking and I
1:08:55
just kind of came up with this in the past day cuz there is a lot of extra
1:09:00
space that they've discovered on the side which you know even if we move
1:09:06
forward in the future with bike Lanes it's not going to happen overnight but
1:09:11
is there a way to use side parking on the side to at least use that space um
1:09:21
so it's not just for those businesses that are in like people don't realize
1:09:27
that these businesses are parking there but technically it's in the city's property so it could be looked at in the
1:09:35
nearer future while it's kind of looking at funding and looking at
1:09:41
possibilities because there really isn't any street parking other than in the neighborhoods for anything on that
1:09:49
Corridor right now I think if somehow we could get someone to Mark out the High round along
1:09:57
I think people would become very surprised to see the corridor what the corridor is I've been studying it a lot
1:10:03
in the plans particularly on the west side not on the side closer to the creek the west side has um there's it varies
1:10:13
but it's it it varies quite a lot from maybe 1 to 2 feet to 6 to 8 ft beyond
1:10:19
what the current sidewalk is now so in other words the city owns property
1:10:26
beyond the sidewalk on the on the west side that could become landscape could have trees it's not owned by the by
1:10:33
businesses they use it because it's it's deemed as theirs but it is the city's
1:10:39
property what I would suggest and um I would like to make a comment about the other half of the memo right so you all
1:10:47
got both parts of the memo um the committee put together a memo on several
1:10:52
items and I I personally just split the zoning one so we can have the zoning discussion I'll let you know on the
1:10:58
other ones cuz we're touching on one of those right there were three specific recommendations that were not zoning
1:11:04
recommendations um one of them concerned U litter in a particular area um one
1:11:09
concerned the uh Mill Street um Crossing for pedestrians and then the third one
1:11:15
concern the the ride of way on either side that we're talking about those are
1:11:21
items uh that are for the administration to work on I'm going to refer the um
1:11:27
pedestrian Crossing one to the Traffic Safety Committee see what they have to say and the other two we will take up
1:11:33
with our uh planning our building department we're a little short-handed um one of them is an easy one one of
1:11:39
them is going to take a while right I mean JC you and I were looking at the RightWay and you know tracks is four
1:11:46
feet into the city's RightWay right the building whereas the other side it can be pretty clean so that's I think
1:11:53
something we can do over time but I think think I want to get the building department involved when they can and come back with how do you want to do
1:11:59
this over time okay so I just wanted you to all hear that because it was related to the topic we're just talking
1:12:06
about thank you for all your work and all your committee's work and thank you Natalie too yeah and yeah we're very
1:12:13
appreciative that you um you know I know we asked you to come you know and it it created a little bit of disruption but
1:12:19
this was about right we're very appreciative um you can see where we're kind of heading you know go back and do
1:12:25
your other stuff you know do your hearing um we're again and keep going on that all right thank you thank you all
1:12:32
thank you you're not off the hook yet Natalie just JC is that all right can we go on the
1:12:39
next one we're good yeah okay um so the next one is um Natalie you put together
1:12:45
a memo last summer uh mid mid 24 about
1:12:50
potential zoning things that we could do for housing um I you know just put up the same memo again and we can start
1:12:57
that discussion again and take a look yeah and I can start with I think um the ones that I remember that kind of rose
1:13:03
to the top I think the short-term one that we had identified was accessory dwelling units adus and looking at that code and seeing um what changes we could
1:13:10
make there to make that process easier and then the other ones that came up was um we talked a lot about the targeting
1:13:17
of city-owned and state-owned lots and let's get a list together of what those lots are and kind of think about those
1:13:23
strategically um further restrictions of short-term rentals that came up as well
1:13:29
as the inclusionary housing policy um those were the ones that kind of got discussed so I did it's the same memo I
1:13:35
haven't changed it but I did do kind of to um Amber's comments earlier I did
1:13:40
look into the Adu regulations and and looked at that um compared that to some
1:13:46
cities that are moving ahead on things like city of Kingston so you know comparing our Adu law to City of
1:13:53
Kingston um they list city of Kingston list a Max size of 1,000 sare ft which
1:13:59
we also have in our code but we also reference a minimum size um of those units which is quite small we it's a
1:14:05
minimum size of 200 square fet um but city of Kingston has kind of removed they they as they went through their
1:14:11
code they removed minimums for a lot of things and just kind of stuck with maximums um there's no parking
1:14:17
requirement for uh adus in the city of Kingston um and then there was I would
1:14:25
have I need to talk to btek the housing um commissioner over there to get clarity on this it did not seem to
1:14:31
reference residency requirements it talked about primary structure like it has to be on a lot with a primary
1:14:39
structure um and there are primary or primary structure but it didn't say the
1:14:44
same kind of language in terms of owner occupied so I just want to get clarity from them on on how that's actually um
1:14:51
implemented and then similarly it look like many of these could be deemed type two actions that would not require uh
1:14:59
planning board approval so that they could be done by staff and again city of Beacon has taken steps um if you're
1:15:05
within an existing structure and you're not um enlarging that structure or renovating that or expanding it um that
1:15:12
again can be approved by staff uh but if it's within an accessory structure such as a garage or an Old Carriage House um
1:15:20
or if you're expanding the primary structure then that does kick you to planning board uh and to Amber to your
1:15:26
point you know although it can happen in one or two meetings I don't think the planning board's really slowing down
1:15:31
that process in terms of those reviews just the fact of putting together those applications you have to then have the
1:15:36
Civil you have to kind of get a civil engineer you have to get the architect they have to put the plans together someone attends the meetings to
1:15:42
represent you there may be tweaks so you come you know you make those revisions so there is that that there is cost to
1:15:50
that review um and I think the program that Chris mentioned is great I love that they are including those costs um
1:15:56
within that as as viable um eligible uh costs to to use that funding for but to
1:16:03
your point um most of these structures cost at least 100,000 if if you're buying like a you know a already set
1:16:11
kind of box there's still 100 Grand at least to build so that 125 per unit um
1:16:17
will get used quite quickly the other thing that Kingson did do as you were referencing is funly enough they were um
1:16:25
they were part of this of the pro same similar program the plus one that Chris
1:16:31
was referring to they actually were part of that in a previous iteration and that's how they got their funding and so
1:16:36
they did also do a design competition uh where they asked for designs and now
1:16:42
they have pre-approved set of designs of for a few different options uh to so
1:16:47
those designs are there ready for people to download so if you can kind of get those to place on your lot it makes that process a lot easier for you as well do
1:16:55
you know if they charge for it or if the like the architects who designed them charge for those plans in Kingston they
1:17:02
are readily downloadable um online they're not the cad files so I'm I'm assuming you would have to I can ask BK
1:17:08
about that too I'm assuming you would have to get the cad file so an engineer can kind of place that on your on your
1:17:14
survey on your parcel yeah it might still be cheaper I think that's a model for other cities who have a similar program that you still pay a fee but it
1:17:21
might not be nearly equivalent to what you would pay I wonder if they might have used some of the plus one funding to cover some of those costs for that
1:17:27
design I I can look into that a little bit more I think I I started looking into the program when I heard Amber mention it um it looks like they had a
1:17:33
competition so I can see how that was how those costs are covered
1:17:39
um did people use all the funds for the initial uh funding that Kingston got for
1:17:44
the Adu I I don't know off the top I can ask that to um but you know I think to that point
1:17:52
you I I think you a a lot of your Adu regulations are there um and they make
1:17:58
sense right and I think it's just some minor tweaks to think about in terms of um you know often on these primary these
1:18:06
single family lots where these are getting placed the parking is not defined so they they have a large driveway and they're like yeah we can
1:18:12
fit three cars there but then when you have that parking requirement they have to start measuring those out and it they
1:18:18
come before the planning board so I think there's the the thought of reducing the parking requirement or
1:18:24
removing it um as one potential and I really think the process is the other one of of removing it wherever you can
1:18:29
having it be by right um that's just a especially for these single family
1:18:34
homeowners that's not a process they're used to so it's a whole it's a whole um
1:18:40
kind of steps for them to take that yeah could be
1:18:45
eliminated I had a question for Nick um Can can this be an area where we um set
1:18:52
the fees at zero it can so as long as you're applying it to a category and it's not
1:18:57
particular applicants you could use this as an area where you modify your fees for the various building permit fees
1:19:04
inspections electrical permits certificates of occupancies yes you could consider that right I I wouldn't I
1:19:10
I would like to know what the building department thinks of that but that might be another thing we could do in this area I like in particular um the ability
1:19:19
I I'd love to get rid of the parking requirement but also the I think the way we set it up was if um as you said
1:19:26
Natalie if the building envelope changes you need a site plan or if you're doing
1:19:32
it on an accessory U building you need a site plan I'd like to I'd like to get
1:19:37
rid of those if we could right that somehow we said there's a few situations where a site plan would be required then
1:19:43
you have to go to planning board but I'd like a lot of them to be up to the building department yeah for the
1:19:49
modification one you can tie that to like a percentage right as long as the primary structure is not being expanded
1:19:54
Beyond 25% or 20% or something right like you could set a limit so if it's a major
1:20:00
remodeling of a primary structure then maybe that ends up getting reviewed but I think there's ways to ensure that most
1:20:06
of these that are simple you know simple small changes to the structure they're usually towards the rear uh because
1:20:12
that's also within the code you know trying to have it kind of set behind the primary structure um that usually the planning
1:20:19
board doesn't even have many comments on on those kinds of changes so you could save that approval process
1:20:27
interesting um Let me let me ask Council um I know we can go through other items on this list but is this one where we'd
1:20:33
like to kind of develop a proposal and move it forward sooner rather than
1:20:40
later I wouldn't put it as my number one priority but it's an area that I'm interested in seeing move
1:20:46
forward well I think if we have that funding and that program established we should be ready on all fronts and have
1:20:53
have this be as streamlined as possible so people can access that money that does increase the priority to me
1:20:58
especially you know again as I said earlier you've got low to moderate income people this is not an inexpensive
1:21:06
thing to do and if they're spending $20,000 on the planning board application like that's a that's a
1:21:12
kitchen like that's that's a lot um so again I don't necessarily think it's
1:21:18
like I would hope that we could do a couple of things at the same time I imagine we're able to do that but
1:21:26
I think because of that program I would just want people to get as much as they can out of it I agree with those
1:21:36
points okay um so what's our next step here can we get maybe
1:21:43
a maybe not legislation but a bullet point proposal would that be a next step
1:21:49
or would we try to draft something I think Natalie and I can speak offline and we can consider for next step is
1:21:55
there like a decision tree memo where we need guidance from you or if we think we have enough direction we can just go ahead and prepare local law I kind of
1:22:02
feel like I at least for where we are now I feel like it's a little easier for me to personally react to more of like a
1:22:08
decision tree memo and for the council to come to consensus on maybe certain points as opposed to having legislation
1:22:15
drafted and trying to react to the legislation in this use case decision treatment's easier so I
1:22:22
like it great okay and I would also add if there are any decision points where
1:22:28
we expect um the people who may be taking use of this um Hudson River housing Grant opportunity um we are
1:22:35
interested in targeting and making this process easier for them if yeah folks
1:22:42
agree with that Focus I do
1:22:48
yeah and then I mean I think in terms of other things again I you know the
1:22:53
council has kind of raised a couple of times wanting to have some additional conversations about the inclusionary
1:23:00
zoning policy and you know this the sense that I get and just speaking
1:23:05
personally is like is what we have working the way that we want it to so
1:23:12
how have our current policies influenced housing Supply and affordability are there things that we
1:23:18
should tweak and then kind of understanding is there more that we should be doing here so interested in
1:23:25
other thoughts on that I don't know where this information
1:23:31
would come from but you know we often hear when U we want to increase the amount of units or percentage for U
1:23:37
affordable housing um developers is saying that's that puts us over you know a break even point or you know we don't
1:23:44
get financing and so I don't know where the information would come from but I'd really like to see what the margins are for developers yeah and understand you
1:23:51
know that you know when when a developer comes to us and says we can't do it or we're not going to build I'd like to
1:23:57
know if that's true you know yeah yeah that's my exact question as well um I um
1:24:03
my understanding I think the quote in Natalie's memo is um we must recognize
1:24:09
that affordable units have to be paid for um and so I would like to know those
1:24:15
details about those margins because if we are getting into the territory of
1:24:20
offering tax breaks or some other form of incentive to get more units or lower
1:24:26
rate units then I would like those numbers to actually match and come from somewhere yeah you know my only advice
1:24:34
is there's not going to be a magic formula right the closest we've gotten and we've gotten you know um the folks
1:24:42
from uh um Community preservation Corporation CPC is that the right um yes
1:24:49
they've done you know I don't know 100,000 units of affordable housing you know in all all across the state the we
1:24:57
brought someone from there who basically said to us you have an unusual statute because you require 10% uh inclusionary
1:25:06
zoning at 70% Ami with no incentive meaning meaning no give back we did it
1:25:13
without changing assessments without a pilot agreement nothing and uh as you
1:25:21
get closer to the city and I I mentioned this to Natalie I think when you get to New York City they have so much density
1:25:27
you might get a higher number I think Yonkers might have a higher number but again they're building a lot of units at a time they still have 10% they vary in
1:25:35
terms of the Ami bands that you're hitting So within that 10% they do do some like deeper Cuts in terms of 40% um
1:25:43
I have their code here so they are one but they are still 10% overall and they differentiate between large developments
1:25:50
medium developments and small developments that's really interesting so does King so Kingston also has
1:25:55
projects 7 to 19 20 to 49 units 50 units or more and then the the um the
1:26:03
percentage of the total affordable units and then also the price points vary within those so oh yeah all of those
1:26:09
levers are ones that I'd be interested in seeing put into a decision tree memo perhaps um for us to consider and make
1:26:16
sure that we're getting the mix that we we want um because I am you know exactly
1:26:21
as Natalie said maybe it is keeping it at 10% but but um getting more deeper
1:26:26
cut lower cost units the housing study has told us that we need some of those lower ranges as well I mean I recognize
1:26:34
that the band that the housing study told us we need the most are ones that we're not going to get through inclusion
1:26:39
area zoning we're only going to get um through different programs but I think moving in that direction is still
1:26:45
important yeah the way we're going to get there and I I think this is a discussion we should take our time to
1:26:50
get our data to make an informed decision because if I remember from the County Housing study because uh our our
1:26:59
um Heritage is a as a small inner city we have um we have lowincome uh projects
1:27:07
in our city and we've actually invested in doing the updates for them and so we're going to have uh kind of deeply
1:27:15
affordable units already our inclusionary one uh zoning was targeted
1:27:21
for U what we called Workforce and as we've gotten more like Westchester right
1:27:28
that's kind of where we we we used to be an Upstate County now a community now we're more of a downstate County
1:27:34
community that that Workforce is an important component and also you know
1:27:39
it's one that we should be targeting so I think we should kind of think about what are our needs let's go to that study see what's there see what do we
1:27:46
what do we have and I think that will inform this I think we're going to end up saying um if we want go to a higher
1:27:54
number we have to give something my only advice to folks is um we already do that
1:28:00
as a fourth floor on Main Street you right we don't require it only to be housing but we say you can get a fourth
1:28:07
floor if you give some public benefit I think that concept is the um most uh
1:28:14
financially viable way for us to create it in set of in other words don't give up tax money don't reduce assessments
1:28:21
with which reduce tax money instead give an extra floor I personally think that
1:28:26
Route 52 is a really good area to consider that it's only in the areas where we're looking at um multifam which
1:28:34
means you know all our single famili is off limits we've already dealt with Main Street maybe we should be looking at you
1:28:40
know providing a fourth floor in return for that first bump if we can kind of demonstrate a higher percentage could
1:28:46
work right that would be my two cents and again we I don't not suggesting we decide any of this we should get all the
1:28:52
data on the table have a very informed discussion uh speaking of data I would
1:29:00
be interested in there are some New York state tax incentive programs and I'm
1:29:05
just curious and there are a couple of uh there's more than one of them um and I'm just curious if there's anything
1:29:10
that we could be doing in our zoning or how we encourage development to help developers make use of those programs so
1:29:17
we're incentivizing them to build things because there's a path that connects directly to these programs um I I I
1:29:23
appreciate that's a very broad statement in category I don't have the detail to know much about them or if there's a way
1:29:29
to figure that out but that's also an area if there's something we discover like oh if we did this this would
1:29:34
actually make accessing these programs easier I would be interested in
1:29:39
that yeah the one area that we we can do something when we get to the list of
1:29:45
projects it's sitting in the back of those projects is would be either trying
1:29:51
to advance the County's site building something right cuz once uh it's
1:29:56
publicly owned you can Target it and the cost of acquiring the land has gone away
1:30:02
right you kind of throw that into the mix to make it work right the other one is the city has several parking lots or
1:30:09
lots that we might also develop that's in our to-do list you know that's a couple of years out we might want to
1:30:15
discuss those as possibilities right they're not on the list right now but you'll see them at the back of the list
1:30:21
of things we might tee up over the next few years yeah in that category that was the one
1:30:27
of the buckets that Natalie introduced us with the city and state owned lots are there next steps with any of those
1:30:33
pending projects that as a council we could or should be taking so just the county one put out
1:30:39
that request for expressions of Interest right um we've got our hands full so if you'll see it on I got a list of all the
1:30:46
stuff we're working on in the next topic and then in the back are what things might we be teeing up over the next few
1:30:52
years that it's in that category and we're looking for a prioritization of the council we're not going to jump and
1:30:59
do them instantly it's going to take a couple of years to do something like that but that's where we should have
1:31:04
that discussion all
1:31:10
right could we talk about the short-term rentals sure that be a good time um I'm
1:31:15
just curious as to if this you know since I was gone for a year what what kind of updates we have on the
1:31:22
enforcement um Chris you might know some numbers I I want to say that the identified short-term rentals in Beacon
1:31:29
you know based on ad counts or whatever was 100 plus when we passed it and it's now under that like maybe 50ish but you
1:31:37
might have a better number off the top of your head Chris I haven't looked lately but it I don't think it's gotten
1:31:44
that low okay um it's it's been a g a bit of a game of whack-a-mole they go up
1:31:49
they go down we're arguing about um under under the law there are certain
1:31:55
Provisions that allow you to say you live there and you're renting it and we're seeing people abusing that by
1:32:01
gaming it so you have somebody that you know and you lease the apartment to them
1:32:07
but they live in Florida and they're renting it on Airbnb but it's
1:32:12
technically legal um so it's been tough we've gotten about uh 35 or 40 of them
1:32:19
licensed as you know they're going to start to be taxed when we start collecting our tax in April um but again
1:32:28
we've had conversations at a staff level like it might just be easier to ban them but I know there's unintended
1:32:34
consequences there because you may not have enough rooms to serve demand clearly they're meeting some kind of
1:32:39
Market um but I did meet with one of your hotel um owners who owns a boutique
1:32:45
hotel and and she's having trouble competing with them and she said there's like a hundred within walking distance
1:32:52
of my facility um so that's one of the things unfortunately like as we have the
1:32:58
transition um that's one of the things we're going to slow down and for a little while and doing because it's it's
1:33:04
it's very intensive um we are identifying them and we're trying to knock out the ones that
1:33:11
are illegal but um the the financial benefits of somebody doing it the
1:33:17
penalties aren't high enough to dissuade them from doing it and we're still using
1:33:23
that organization to gain well we we use an app uh it's a
1:33:29
granicus um AI U software that identifies them on
1:33:35
the sites and then we issue letters um but by the time by the time you issue a
1:33:40
letter they've already been able to rent it out for months has there anybody any communities that have been successfully
1:33:45
enforcing this or are there any other ways to do it that we're aware
1:33:51
of um I I everyone looks to New Orleans is like one of the I know it's far away but they created an entire division to
1:33:59
like multi over 50 staff to like monitor right to monitor airbnbs in that City
1:34:05
and they had three different typologies and without doing that I think to Chris's Point like it it becomes it
1:34:11
becomes very time consuming um and staff intensive uh a lot of communities have
1:34:19
have gone towards Banning I can look into that in terms of like who but I'm sure enforcement is going to to be a
1:34:24
number one issue for uh for many of the communities I know the state just passed
1:34:29
a regulation for them all to be registered um I don't know that the stage of implementation I'm sure it's
1:34:36
some time off because they have to develop the rules for how that work right and that registration is just for tax purposes right yeah but there would
1:34:43
be penalties if they didn't register that the state would apply and enforce if that were the case I don't know if
1:34:51
it's an enforcement provision I would imagine so but again it's only for tax purposes not for local zoning I mean I think I think we're
1:34:58
controlling it to some level but not enough right it it's just it's
1:35:04
really energy I mean we could have a staff person doing that all the time um so if you don't want them then ban them
1:35:11
and but then you're going to have a lot of people who have invested money in these units and um but I I think there's
1:35:18
some people openly doing it who you know given time will get them mhm but but
1:35:25
again we we have to choose every day what we're going to focus on yeah so I guess the conversation is we should
1:35:31
begin speaking about it as possible Banning and what the impacts of that might be yeah or maybe some in between
1:35:38
you know years ago we zoned out uh bottom floor apartments on Main Street
1:35:44
and somebody had just invested on in the West End in those and we gave them 5 years and then had them amortise out
1:35:52
after which you couldn't do it so maybe there's like a ramp down or something maybe you limit the number I don't I
1:35:58
don't know there must be other municipalities that have come up with ideas um Nick can you um help remind us
1:36:06
I thought our law said that um if you live in your own home or whatever
1:36:13
residence you could short-term rental out a piece of that or all of that as
1:36:18
long as it was where you lived um but if you had an accessory unit on your lot that had to get a
1:36:25
long-term rental that is correct yes that's true and so I would just be
1:36:31
careful if we're going to because I think we've gone that step and a lot of other places haven't of of if you got
1:36:37
two units and you live in one you can't short-term rental the other you can only shortterm rental your own correct um so
1:36:43
I think you we may want to visit how we write the law now what the issues are
1:36:48
and what options there might be because I don't think there's any problem if someone really does live in their home
1:36:54
and they're going away for the month of June they should be able to rent it out right um but it's it's the how you get
1:37:01
around the law distinguish them from yeah that exactly right yeah
1:37:08
yeah all right and then the one that I heard that we we don't allow and I
1:37:13
thought it's a pretty good argument for why we should is I've heard s a situation where um it's a a family
1:37:21
living in the place they have an accessory to dwelling unit and you know a parent comes uh you know two or 3
1:37:27
months a year and stays with them but then what do you do the rest of the time you can't do a long-term lease uh in
1:37:34
that situation and that one struck me as a legitimate reason to want to allow it
1:37:39
but it's not their main unit it's it's their accessory unit um so we you know I'm not saying that we should allow that
1:37:46
I'm just saying that was the one I heard that's like oh that was a pretty good argument so how do we want to proceed on do we
1:37:53
want to get a package together that we can look at of here's what the law says now here's what we know about um
1:38:00
enforcement here's what maybe a couple of other places have done yeah I think it's key as other municipalities and
1:38:06
what their experiences are and updates on what I think though you're going to find we can do that I think you're going to find that enforcement is difficult
1:38:14
and that a total ban is what works or totally permitting it works sort of this in between it comes down to regulation
1:38:21
and it's very time intensitive is there any could we gather information from local municipalities that have Bandit
1:38:26
and see what kind of push back and what kind of experiences they had is the timing a little tough right now due to
1:38:33
our building department well we were going to have Bruce come to a meeting
1:38:38
before April and then just a few days later he submitted his resignation now I don't know if those are actually
1:38:44
connected or not um I'll let let him talk about uh he's only here for a week
1:38:51
and a half so I don't think he's going to be able to do it so I think we're going to have to the local information
1:38:57
will will get when the next person's in but I I think I agree with George's
1:39:04
Direction when we do have the capacity to look at seriously what it would look
1:39:09
like to ban them entirely if these really are the two main options that we have it's not a decision I think any of
1:39:15
us would take lightly but um I think it's worth consideration but wasn't it happening when it was banned and that
1:39:22
was the problem why we came up with something that it was happening and there was no nothing really that could
1:39:29
be done I mean I think enforcement will be an issue regardless I think part of what was also confusing at the time was
1:39:37
that um there were sort of conflicting policies on the state and city level like the city had allowed it but the
1:39:43
state didn't or the state had allowed it but the city hadn't someone correct me I maybe being totally apocryphal right now
1:39:49
no when so there were several I iterations of this law law and enforcement and when we initially
1:39:56
enforced the approv the building department there was conflicting views from New York State as to how it would be enforced they didn't agree with our
1:40:03
interpretation of um what was permitted in a dwelling unit was not necessarily consistent with have a state view to Pro
1:40:09
a State Building Code but then we moved beyond that and adopted the local law that you implemented
1:40:16
right I hope we come up with a better solution but if if we're going to seriously consider it it seems like
1:40:22
that's what we should consider yeah I would like to hear more but I understand timing just isn't right
1:40:30
at this moment so what I would suggest is um we wrap up this particular topic
1:40:36
for now we say we're going to come back with some information but it's not happening for a few months right I just
1:40:42
want to make set some one question Nick could you look at whether we could cap
1:40:47
them yes could we say there's 40 allowed and then we we say if you have have one
1:40:53
of these you come and get it licensed or or we pick a number and then anything above that you have to go through a
1:41:00
process later on to get so that way you've kind of you have your licensed ones and you know everybody else is you
1:41:07
can go at and it and it would be a lottery of sorts I don't know I would give precedence to the people that have done
1:41:13
the right thing and already licensed them yeah yeah I like that idea um and
1:41:19
just to clarify in terms of tabling and not revisiting for a few months are you referring to just the short-term rental
1:41:25
aspect or the other pieces that we talked about because I think there's some things that we can get to sooner
1:41:31
yeah okay yeah just the short ter yeah well I think what we said was we're we're trying to move quickly on the
1:41:38
Route 52 stuff then we can talk start to do um broader deeper discussion on um
1:41:47
Adu decision well the Adu we thought was pretty quick and then the inclusionary zoning will take some effort and putting
1:41:55
material together uh this one might take a little bit longer because we may not have the resource in building department
1:42:01
for help okay but let's you know we'll we'll kind of keep you posted as to where we are is that what's okay with
1:42:06
Council yes cool this is really good um okay do we want to take anything else on
1:42:13
this list or and we can pick it up again uh if we want I wouldn't put it as a
1:42:19
priority ahead of anything we just said but I was curious Natalie if you could say more on um as as a planner how you
1:42:26
define smart growth um there are quite a few interesting ideas under that bullet point um and I'd like to just give some
1:42:34
context for why those might be priorities yeah sorry as you were no
1:42:39
that's I should ped down I I remember that I defined this the last time so I was just pulling out my notes there so I
1:42:45
mean there smart growth in the same way that you'll get affordability to find
1:42:51
different ways you'll get complet find different ways right there's many iterations it can take but in general
1:42:56
the tenants of smart growth are uh mix of building types compact design uh
1:43:02
range of housing opportunities and choices walkable and Transit supported uh preserving open space and
1:43:09
critical environmental areas again that kind of comes in with if you have compact design then you can protect the
1:43:15
areas that need to be protected um directing development towards existing communities with
1:43:20
infrastructure um and then development decisions are predictable fair and cost effective that was my notes from the
1:43:27
last time in terms of this is all sounding very familiar yeah in terms of kind of what you think
1:43:33
about with smart growth and how did you sort of with those definitions how did you come up with these sort of five
1:43:39
bullet points of how we make that actionable yeah so I mean if you if we
1:43:45
want to go through so permitting two family homes in in single family districts again this is kind of looking
1:43:51
at compact development right um me not just Beacon many communities the majority of the land area within that
1:43:57
Community are designated to single family homes only so there is consideration of is there a way it's
1:44:03
kind of like a increasing soft density right in terms of where there's only one can there be two units and you're doing
1:44:09
that a little bit with your Adu units as well um but I think there's a general trend of looking at that again it's
1:44:15
existing sewered infrastructured area is there a way to increase density there in
1:44:20
a softway that respects like the context of the the of the neighborhood in the community um again looking at updating
1:44:28
higher density zones tracks directly with more compact development um increased development
1:44:35
near public transportation again identifying you know where there's already infrastructure um and then again multif
1:44:42
family comes back back to the density so all those and smaller lot sizes again it's kind of just trying to make more
1:44:49
compact um development where where there's already already kind of the built form and the infrastructure to
1:44:55
support it so those all really tie in with that you're you're essentially just trying to prevent kind of sprawl so a
1:45:03
lot of times it's going up rather than out or allowing for smaller spaces to be
1:45:09
or large spaces to be better utilized I think the one area that we
1:45:15
discussed um besides the Adu piece and and I can give you a data point it's in
1:45:20
the comprehensive plan uh of the land that we have in the city that is for residential housing uh almost 80% of it
1:45:28
is R1 meaning single family right a little bit less than 80 like
1:45:34
75ish uh to 80 and one of the options we're talking about is the Adu that alters that and I
1:45:40
I think it's really appropriate because if you look at our Census Data um we increase the number of housing units in
1:45:47
the city in the last 10 years and we didn't increase our population and that's because our average household
1:45:52
size is declining and that the areas that were traditional single family home areas actually have fewer people in it
1:46:00
than they did 20 and 30 years ago in terms of per capita right and so the Adu
1:46:05
actually starts to kind of bring it back to where it was we could go further and go to two family um zoning the other
1:46:12
option in while you know this is is to consider may possibly areas that are single family that we might um alter and
1:46:20
allow uh D denser and that that would be around our main street and I think
1:46:25
that's one we might want to talk about right the transition uh with the transitional District as right yeah so
1:46:31
extending that idea but not necessarily that literal zoning right right and that
1:46:36
might be an area that we could talk about without saying you know we're going to alter all the single family
1:46:41
neighborhoods but rather only the ones closest to Main Street uh that we might consider right yeah I'd be interested in
1:46:47
doing that I also feel this is an area where as we have the comprehensive plan process as likely to kick off next year
1:46:54
for finalization the following year that might also be an area because it impacts a lot potentially a lot of the land in
1:47:00
the city um and so thinking about both where we might want multif family within single family and this idea there might
1:47:07
be areas where we have larger Lots outside of the center we would be okay with smaller Lots still single family
1:47:13
but not necessarily the size that we have now and so I think that's those are all ideas that I would really want the
1:47:18
public to weigh in on and so it's not to say that precludes us from having conversation here but that might any
1:47:24
decision might might might be best suited for that comprehensive plan
1:47:30
process yeah I I would just say I I want to compliment this conversation I think
1:47:35
this is a great conversation this evening um what i' I'd like us to do if we could is if we can keep moving on
1:47:42
some of these we're effectively starting to define components of in the comp plan that might be changing and if we can get
1:47:49
some of them done right I think it it kind of sets up that work right the council could have a memo just like the
1:47:55
fish cab committee say here are the things we think and then the the we've already done and here's things yeah that
1:48:02
we might want to do right because if we do if we spend enough time doing kind of planning and looking at the long term
1:48:07
like this I think we could set that up pretty well right I just want to point out that we talk about this return this
1:48:13
um turning R1 into possible two family units and so on that's a return almost
1:48:19
because that's the way it used to be mhm um so it's going right and and it's a way it is organically around certainly
1:48:26
where I live and where lots of people live who are closer to Main Street in that sort of Central District closer to
1:48:32
the train station yeah I would be very curious to sort of see that old map and
1:48:37
understand which buildings and which neighborhoods may have been built as multif family homes but become single
1:48:43
family homes and may already be set up to go back as George
1:48:48
said yeah I mean it's some some of it's that but I think to the marriage Point some of is just there was house
1:48:54
household sizes used to be multigenerational and and larger and include staff as well as the members of
1:49:02
the primary household right all living Under One Roof and one shared space and we've just moved away from that as a
1:49:07
society um but I think we can look again that would be a a building department
1:49:13
intensive kind of exercise to look through those files to see what was historically multif family um and maybe
1:49:19
that's a red herring and it's about uh looking at uh what exists now from another perspective but something I'm
1:49:27
curious about well one of the areas we're clearly starting to go back to the future is on our main street right
1:49:34
because the 1960s and70s comprehensive plan said oh get rid of those three-story buildings we're going to
1:49:40
compete with the mall we're going to have a you know walking Main Street single story buildings and you could see
1:49:46
some of that has occurred and we're kind of undoing it right and we're bringing um three stories back to Main Street and
1:49:53
and sometimes four so there's a few areas where I think we can do it I think the the outlying areas of the city were
1:50:01
were built out as single family because they were done in the period of time where that was what everybody thought
1:50:07
was the right thing to do right we're building levit towns or whatever you want to call them right so
1:50:15
yeah um okay on this any other one we want to pick up and we can come back to
1:50:20
some of these we're teeing up a few that we're going start bringing forward we can come back and pick up some more in fact what I would suggest is maybe in a
1:50:28
somewhere time of the next month that maybe we all sit down um you know Nick Natalie Chris me and go through what
1:50:35
else is in this memo might we want to tee up another one or two along the way and de deal with them a piece at a time
1:50:41
is that okay right we won't we're not trying to let any of them drop as much as picking some to move forward one at a
1:50:47
time okay do we want to pick up the is this okay on on this zoning stuff do we want
1:50:54
to pick up the last item of business or are we getting close to time we should have a tour of what it is yeah that's
1:51:01
what I was going to what I was going to suggest is let me take you through what's in there give and then give you
1:51:06
all a chance to digest it because there's a lot in there is that okay Natalie that would be perfect okay thank
1:51:11
you Natalie thanks Natalie because I'm gonna blow your minds if I'm going to ask you to prioritize right so thank you
1:51:19
Natalie okay um so first of all uh let me tell you the thinking behind this um
1:51:27
the thing you got to know is these are projects these are not day-to-day and if you asked me and I've asked this of
1:51:33
Chris and Ben like if just take um call Administration Administration is um the
1:51:41
mayor part-time the city administrator and the mayor's assistant a dumb title
1:51:46
for Ben um you know I would argue that 80% of the time is spent doing the
1:51:54
operational stuff and that projects are maybe 20% of that time and I'm we're making it up right we don't really know
1:52:01
but we this is a list of projects okay and what um what I did I put it together
1:52:08
um Chris and Ben have looked at it we think we're in the ballpark there'll be changes or whatever but what I tried to
1:52:15
do was to say what projects are teed up the starting point was the capital plan
1:52:22
and so everything that's in this year's Capital plan is listed in here there are items that were in Prior year Capital
1:52:29
plans um that um the work hasn't been done but was already approved in the
1:52:34
capital plan right so that it doesn't add up to just one year's Capital plan then it's organized by um which
1:52:43
department is the in addition to the administration so figure column d uh oh
1:52:49
I think you've got a you don't have an Excel you've got a have okay the First Column that says admin time is how much
1:52:57
of either Chris's and it's mostly Chris's Benz or Le's time are we talking
1:53:03
about and it's kind of listed as high medium low because we're making it up right then also often times there's a
1:53:10
department that has to be involved so obviously the projects involving construction involve the highway
1:53:16
department and how much of their time were we talking about and then um the
1:53:23
the next two columns are if it's somebody else's money where is it coming from if it's our money is it a capital
1:53:29
item or is it in our operating budget and then how much are we talking about and there's two columns one other
1:53:35
people's money which we like a lot and the other one is our money right our taxpayer money and so that's how this is
1:53:42
structured and it's done in groups right then as you get to the back we're done
1:53:48
with all the things that we're teeing up this year or the next couple of years and there's things that we want to stick
1:53:55
in the hopper right so in the back I think there's 52 items before you get to the back and then they started again
1:54:02
numbering in in item 101 right and we tried to tee up things that we've talked
1:54:07
about aren't teed up yet as things we would want to discuss discuss all right
1:54:13
so what what we tried so and I'll give you an example the very first item is
1:54:18
finishing fish kill teller Avenue right we've teed it up in our comprehensive plan I'm sorry our Capital plan there's
1:54:25
still 8 it was an $8 million project it's all somebody else's money which we
1:54:30
like we just have to finish it um it involves a fair amount of Chris's time
1:54:37
and a medium amount of the highway department time that's how to read this okay and Lee can I just clarify it's not
1:54:43
just my time and Ben's time we also bring in the city engineer on every
1:54:48
Capital project that's a limitation you're legal team is also
1:54:54
involved in they look over every bid every contract we're we're if you look
1:55:00
at our park ones you know we're we're going through various procurement processes for those um so that those are
1:55:08
the limitations so that support staff is vital and then the other element is finance because they have to do a
1:55:15
purchase order for everything they have to track the invoices um for the for the
1:55:20
firehouse we've had well over 100 invoices right and so those are kind of
1:55:25
too hard to kind of document or or whatever so this was an attempt to say
1:55:31
let's try to do a list of the items some sense of what we talking about in terms of expense who's paying for it when is
1:55:38
it getting teed up to get done and who's got to who's got to be involved besides engineer lawyer Finance all
1:55:46
right so we look down the list and again I we don't have to make any choices I'm
1:55:51
just trying to give you a lay of the land and then I'd ask you just take a look at it the first one all involves
1:55:56
sort of um projects of General size but they get smaller as you get toward the
1:56:02
bottom of that first 19 those are all the highway department as you get close to the bottom parks department the Mark
1:56:09
is managing the recreation oh was that right it's not it's not Mickey all right so I should have split those out um but
1:56:16
as you but again Mickey has a role and also then Ed helps with locating uh sewer and water infrastructure sure all
1:56:22
right and those are people who have full-time jobs so there's only a certain amount of capacity that they have to
1:56:28
help this along right so as you see in like 16 17 18 there's a set of uh work
1:56:35
that we're doing on City Hall um exterior painting interior painting uh reconfiguring the clerk window those are
1:56:43
largely going to be done by internal staff right we're not going to hire out for those um are the chairs in there
1:56:52
I'm kidding I'm with you we should make that a separate item they're coming they're
1:57:00
coming I I've sent staff shopping already I like go pick out chairs right
1:57:05
yes I love it um no that's right the the police item is somebody else's money
1:57:11
right because those are vehicles that we're getting funding for right I want you to see one in particular which is uh
1:57:19
underwater swords item 24 we had applied for uh a mzinga dam um uh Grant which we
1:57:26
did not get we were surprised cuz we thought the reason we were told we didn't get it didn't get it didn't make
1:57:31
any sense um but we checked Chris said hey I don't have to do that this year
1:57:38
and we want to move it from our money to somebody else's money right and we think waiting a year is worth doing for that
1:57:45
right because it might get a couple million dollars of Grant and so one of the choices that we make we want to show
1:57:51
you some of those choices is delay to get somebody else's money as opposed to our own now the other thing to note
1:57:58
about water sewer is remember those aren't tax dollars those are the water andur fees now you could argue you know
1:58:05
we should try to keep those as low as possible but it is different than raising the tax mind you these are also
1:58:13
items we have to bond right and so they go into our bonding total and you know we Bond a lot that's the only thing the
1:58:20
the rating agency has told us is a ding for us is that you Bond a lot although
1:58:25
you've got the capacity you've got a great general fund but you're at a at the higher end so we just need to be
1:58:31
careful there so I want you to see those then there's after you get through the capital ones there's a set of operating
1:58:37
type of projects these are smaller right because they're not in our Capital plan
1:58:43
um and as you kind of go down the list there's also some involving planning and zoning and these aren't our decisions
1:58:49
these are uh pieces of the puzzle we would be asking someone else to do right
1:58:55
well some of these are ours too um so one of the ones that are teed up under Planning and Zoning the first one is the
1:59:01
speed limit reduction study so the council said oh we want to do that and so we took our time and we got it funded
1:59:08
by somebody else's money that's County money right it's not funded yet it's not funded yet no we have to apply okay at
1:59:15
the next funding round so we're hoping to get it funded from somebody else's money yes and I've spoken to them and
1:59:20
they think it's a very good project okay but that's kind of how we how we try to
1:59:25
te these up is we get the list try to figure out what it's going to cost try to get somebody else to pay for it and
1:59:31
then that's our list going down once you get to the through the ones there's a future project section that's the one
1:59:38
that I would suggest we spend some time talking about and if we want items to
1:59:44
come in here and they're all you know to be determined in terms of how much are
1:59:49
we talking about but some of those ideas we have talked about um you know do we
1:59:55
reconfigure the Churchill Street intersection with Main Street do we reconfigure the East main intersection
2:00:01
with Main Street those are not on our lists and we you know I think we're all going to say some of these are important
2:00:08
there's also new ones like you know in your budget that we approved we talked
2:00:13
about some kind of a complete streets type of Grant I broke them into two and said a sidewalk master plan a bike
2:00:20
master plan but this would be the area that once you digest this I would suggest we talk about this section here
2:00:27
and what kinds of things are important we won't have absolute answers but we'll
2:00:32
as a council get to these seem to be important let's see if we can price them figure out how to get someone else to
2:00:39
pay for them which ones are higher priority which ones are lower priority okay that's what we were trying to do
2:00:45
here does that make any sense and is it a decent explanation yeah makes a lot of sense
2:00:52
and I think it's really helpful to see some of this laid out um I think this is probably something we should kind of
2:01:00
keep as a working document and build on as things progress but um this is a very
2:01:05
helpful view of all the things that are going on in city as well as for us as we go into budgeting and capital planning
2:01:12
to make sure that we're advancing those future projects um so that they can
2:01:17
actually get done yeah and and you know just so you know I mean I was on Council
2:01:22
for a number of years where our Capital our 5-year Capital plan was a one-year Capital plan we've now gotten ourselves
2:01:28
to 5 years which is what we should be doing but you all recognize that the fifth year in that plan is all if come
2:01:35
maybe right and we don't know how certain that is this will be similar to that you know the list of things that
2:01:41
we're working on will be pretty clean um some of them will take more than one year it's this list in the back of what
2:01:48
are we trying to tee up and you know the thing I would say by doing it this way
2:01:54
is to encourage you all to say oh it's not going to come instantly if I just put it on the table it'll get done there
2:02:00
are other things we got to work we have to figure out how it fits in how we fund
2:02:05
okay yeah it seems like being a spreadsheet which are just lovely you can always add columns I mean based on
2:02:11
your description it'd be nice to see some some the plans Horizon for when these are going to get completed it'd be
2:02:18
nice to see what the anticipated the the hoped for as part of that conversation I mean I you know ideally seeing you know
2:02:24
we hear Chris describe this all the time that there's so much going on but seeing comparative columns in sort of a Gant
2:02:29
chart way so knowing when these projects are sliding about would be very helpful
2:02:35
yeah I you know we actually talked about you know are we going to try to say what's the what's the Gant chart look
2:02:41
like how many quarters are we talking about for this one or that one that was just getting way too speculative I
2:02:46
actually did a version of that um but I I think what's more relevant is that
2:02:51
that's big bigger picture for now right this as a council I think is the right level for you to kind of see this issue
2:02:58
okay I guess so I mean to Jeff's point out you know the detail that goes into a gamp chart I don't know that I really
2:03:04
necessarily need for each of these but you know what might be helpful is like a Target start or a Target completion to
2:03:12
at least give us an idea of like this one's in progress this one's you know we're not working on it for two years um
2:03:18
1 through 19 or all this year with the exception of the Main Street uh Visitor
2:03:25
Center bathroom I'm not sure what that meant Le are we we were R doing them or
2:03:31
are they redone no they're you going to make it access to the public we thought about maybe having an exterior access at
2:03:37
some point I think that's further off but everyone on that is already underway
2:03:42
and either going to be completed by the end of this year or mid next year with like the longest one we have out right
2:03:49
now is the dewatering um replacement at the wastewater treatment plant so all of those
2:03:56
are pretty close okay that's great it just helps us answer questions too if we just see a bar start and stop date we
2:04:03
can answer questions and people ask us so that would be lovely is this was most of the first page is this year um like I
2:04:10
said but even within this year seeing the start date when it's picked back up when it's finished and then we can see where they where they sit next to each
2:04:17
other well I I think it would be even simpler than that just to be able to say this year right we're going to finish it
2:04:25
this year good enough right cuz then you know what's what's coming up I don't think you need to know what month right
2:04:32
I think it's just we're doing these this year and some of them are going on right now interior painting is happening um
2:04:38
we're we're still processing paperwork for Fishkill teller which is going to resume at the end of March um we're
2:04:46
putting together bid documents right now for the park with um Keenan Bean
2:04:52
um so a lot of these are moving already but I I hear that piece of input and I think that's an easy one to kind of get
2:04:59
a version of it there that works okay it's nice just to have an understanding of the capacity how the planning is done
2:05:06
the resource planning so when we ask for something else to be done even just seeing this year in more detail how
2:05:14
projects sit next to each other or don't because of the capacity and the timing or the weather requirements it helps us
2:05:20
in the planning for the future discussions mhm okay so we'll we'll meet
2:05:25
in the future and talk about the um the future projects that the back L yeah that would be myou that I could add on
2:05:31
immediately exactly and we don't claim to know them all right um and I think as a group we should be looking at those um
2:05:39
and I don't know exactly where they fit in there some of them may end up in a capital plan some of them may end a
2:05:45
budget some of them may end up we're talking about them and they don't get teed up for a while but somewhere we
2:05:50
pick up pick them up in a discussion is that right it's also yeah and I also think it's important that the public be
2:05:55
aware that we're aware of some of these things because they might be like why AR isn't that happening why is that happening yeah it's good to see it
2:06:02
prioritized at at least being considered you know y yeah right thank you okay
2:06:07
great um one item that isn't on here yet that I know we talked about as city
2:06:13
council for our budget process is Communications and I just think as we kind of have these discussions having
2:06:19
that just be an item to that we bring up with what do we mean that what do we want to do this year and future years so
2:06:24
just as as an specific item that came up y I think that's fine it's also missing the comprehensive
2:06:31
plan uh yes we have a little time for that yeah right well some of these are several years out too so it's a
2:06:37
comprehensive no agreed right and that's what I said it's not a complete list it was just us trying to figure it out like
2:06:43
what's on our what's on our calendar and there's no there's no sub indication of priority within this list necessarily
2:06:49
one to 19's all have but I mean that would be helpful too it's like to some degree I know it's not easy and clean
2:06:55
you can't do it all but some indication of what the priorities and what's being put off because you're going to look for another grant that would be helpful and
2:07:01
again I want to see more on timing okay all right all
2:07:07
right motion to adjourn uh before I entertain that any
2:07:14
other thoughts or comments before I entertain Amber's motion can I just ask
2:07:20
what your think thinking with the 114 housing developed parking lot number
2:07:26
one um yeah so we had talked about U
2:07:32
eventually looking at City owned lots and doing some sort of project there
2:07:38
it's it's basically saying don't know which don't know when but we had talked about it kind of going above it yeah so
2:07:45
one option has been where the police parking lot is you know right in the the notch where Maine and and beakman and 9d
2:07:54
of would we' build something there that was one another one was the two lots on
2:07:59
Henry behind Main Street right don't know which you know we haven't we talked about it it was in the Main Street AIS
2:08:06
committee but there's no advancement and I just put it on the list as a I don't know but we should talk about that right
2:08:13
and if we think it's important we should spend enough time that we get it into some queue if we think we know how to
2:08:19
fund it I think the best example is going to be the county and their DMV lot we I'd like to see what they're doing
2:08:25
there that might give us a model to work okay okay thank you um
2:08:33
Amber motion to adjourn second just announcing your next meeting next meeting yep uh oh yes uh before we do
2:08:41
that the next meeting will be on February 3rd at 7 o'clock all right see
2:08:47
you then all right and all in favor say I I all right thank you all
2:08:52
