0:15
okay we're going to start the workshop portion of the evening uh from 700 to 7:30 and so then at 7:30 we will start
0:24
our regular agenda and for Workshop this evening we have a few uh local laws that
0:29
the city has asked us to review and share uh our feedback to them for um one of them
0:37
having to do with uh I don't know if there's a more technical name for it I
0:42
don't think there's a technical name for either one so and then there's some zoning map uh changes we want to discuss
0:48
so are you going to start us off sure which one do you want to talk about first Eenie Meenie you want to Zing map
0:54
changes Len says zoning map Len got it that's the easy one we got to start off gently
1:01
EAS our way way into the meeting okay so um these this is a local
1:06
law that was referred from the city council to the planning board for its recommendations and review um this local
1:14
law would amend the city zoning map with respect to um the parcels at one East
1:21
Main Street so that's for all of the condo units plus the common area at one East Main Street to rezone it from the
1:29
LI District the light industrial district to the CMS District um this was
1:34
brought up by former building inspector Bruce flower um on one of his last days
1:41
in office the city of Beacon uh he made a recommendation to Chris White City
1:47
administrator um for the rezoning of 1 East Main Street along with 7 East Main and Churchill uh The Churchill parking
1:54
lot owned by the city from Li to CMS um and some of the reasons that he gave are
2:01
in the memo uh which is in your your materials on the agenda but generally
2:06
that the that that area um is kind of more dominated by retail um and
2:13
restaurant type uses that you see in the CMS District versus the light industrial uses uh that you would see elsewhere in
2:21
the city so say that the restaurant uses were actually prohibited in Li too so they were like I thought I food
2:27
preparation is prohibited um I don't think restaurant P per se is prohibited
2:33
if I recall but there was there was a mismatch even even though on top of the fact that it seems like it's more suited
2:40
to CMS yeah actually restaurant and coffee house is prohibited in the LI
2:45
correct restaurant is okay I coffee actually prohibited where they are which doesn't make sense so that's a good
2:52
reason to sort of yeah so the the local law that has been presented would only be for one East Main um the city council
3:00
decided not to include 7 East Main which is the Hudson Brewery and and its own
3:05
parking lot within the scope of this local law so it would just be that that one East Main area um you're going to
3:11
ask why yeah exactly you can see my mouth forming the question why which is what what I asked as well earlier today
3:18
um and one of the reasons is that the um the owner of the Hudson Brewery uh did
3:24
was was not in favor of resoning to the CMS District um based on his belief that
3:35
it would limit um his use his uses there would it in fact be more restrictive I I
3:41
don't know um I I didn't look into his objection but the city council didn't include it so that's not part of the
3:50
referral so yeah that use would not the Hudson Brewery lot would not be affected
3:56
by this it would continue as it as it has and his it would be an accessory use his if he has food trucks or whatever
4:04
whatever he doesn't have those would would not be I'm saying if they're prohibited then how does nothing would change so whatever he's doing now
4:11
pre-existing noning use well I don't think that it is not preexisting no hising pre-existing to a zoning change
4:18
that made it illegal I don't know that it would be made illegal because breweries are allowed in the CMS
4:24
District No so I think his use was approved at a time when breweries didn't exist in the code um so his use may have
4:32
been classified at the time as like a more of a manufacturing industrial use
4:37
which would not be permitted in CMS but regardless breweries are permitted in CMS Brewing quite a bit and selling it
4:44
elsewhere so would that be more of a manufacturing than possibly again I this is not something that I you know I
4:52
looked into for the purposes of the referral because it wasn't included yeah but it also selling food which is
4:58
prohibited in industrial um he not be himself I think he has food
5:03
trucks well it's basically an accessory use which with regard to the other
5:09
referral we got was we'll discuss that later on but
5:15
um well I'm sorry yeah so I think the city council is looking to you as far as
5:21
your recommendations on whether it makes sense to rezone one East Main from Li to
5:27
the CMS District so that I took a look at this at some length and for what it's
5:33
worth i' spent a fair amount of time over the years contemplating um changes
5:39
to with the creation of new zoning districts and changes yeah um if you look at the
5:47
map sorry if you look at the zoning map um
5:55
adjacent to the parcel to the South um adjacent to the Hudson Valley Brewery in
6:01
one East Main parcel is uh another repurposed industrial building that's in
6:08
GB if you hop one or two Parcels up you
6:15
hit how am I not remembering this uh roundhouse roundhouse thank you which is
6:20
also a GB also repurposed industrial looking at so first looking
6:28
at other areas on the map that are Li the current usage of the parcels we're talking about doesn't match up very well
6:35
y it looks to me like it matches up a lot better with GB one thing I did and
6:40
this is coming at it from the rationale of if it ain't broke don't fix it you know the reality is the two exigencies
6:47
or I don't know about exigencies but issues that led Bruce to be raising this
6:53
are one East Main is occupied by m a multif family dwelling and among other
7:00
things a coffee shop which are both prohibited Li uses both of those would be permitted uses in GB now what
7:08
significant is this is a spreadsheet I did in 15 minutes before the meeting so I'm not
7:15
guaranteeing this is 100% correct I think it's 100% correct in terms of
7:20
permitted uses whether things are permitted forbidden or special permit
7:26
changing from Li to GB changes eight
7:32
uses everything else stays the same two of those uses are the ones I just mentioned changing to CMS changes 22 of
7:41
the uses I think another thing that happens is the
7:46
dimensional requirements on Lots change and the dimensional requirements that
7:51
are in CMS are really more intended for buildings that are actually adjacent to Main Street not separated by a railroad
7:58
track where you're not going to get foot traffic um so I will that was a good 3
8:03
or 4 minutes I'll shut up after this when I looked at it my solid takeaway was yes it makes sense to reone this but
8:09
it would make the only way this is coming up is if like a tornado or something destroys these buildings and
8:15
it's a matter of it's groundup construction what do we want to allow as a matter of right in particular I don't think we want lot line buildings as a
8:22
matter of right in this location which is one of the aspects of of CMS dimensional regulation and I said i'
8:30
sh up but I will just say one other thing with regard to changing use regulations just from a planning point
8:37
of view um dimensional restrictions you can get
8:44
variances from at the zoning board the standard isn't typically that high use
8:50
regulations the standard that is supposed to be being applied is relatively high you're normally not getting off them the point being changes
8:58
to what is and is not what are and are not permitted uses are going to have a
9:04
much bigger Splash going forward than are changes to dimensional rugs yeah
9:11
yeah now that's super helpful so what about the design uh guidelines but you wouldn't have the CMS design guidelines
9:18
but at the same time again if a tornado destroys one East Main Street and they're building something new from the
9:23
ground up it's not going to be that analogous to what on the rest of CMS and
9:28
we've got s plan approval anyway to put some restraints in there
9:34
so yeah yeah I I definitely think ahead to just that eventuality you know um and
9:42
you know a degree of consistency which you're sort of um talking about as well uh within that that area that's yeah
9:52
so yeah I so I don't know necessarily where to take it then right um
9:59
just wonder if there is yeah so Bruce made this recommendation just based on his
10:06
observations that there is some inconsistencies relative to this specific site right yeah and of course
10:12
you rais a very good point um David about why then other areas wouldn't be
10:18
considered even if specific owners don't necessarily like the idea or is it
10:26
better to leave well enough alone um
10:31
yeah so more discussion I mean thoughts just some a little bit of background
10:37
these when I we were doing the Fishkill Creek resoning study um these were the
10:43
properties that were that had active development proposals that were under under consideration right so the
10:48
roundhouse property had been a long time long uh time span application process
10:56
with various uh uh proposals on it that were being encouraged by the city because not
11:02
much else was happening right and we were all everyone was very anxious to
11:07
um uh there were many people in the city that were anxious to start um the gentrification at that time this is many
11:14
years ago and the uh um the this uh uh sort of one East
11:21
Main property was also uh underactive there there were multiple some of which
11:27
uh proposals some of which didn't succeed um I also know that um just my
11:33
experience was that I was had advocated during some of that early rezoning
11:39
process to retain uh industrial and other um uh uses in the city which there
11:48
was a lot of skepticism about and uh when this was used as a light industrial
11:53
use I'm feeling like really good about it because I was like having a diverse
11:59
economic base in this town was something that uh was sort of it would sort of pro the case and it was something that could
12:05
that was possible here so I support the idea of maintaining the light industrial for that zone right because it sort of
12:13
protects that unique sort of use in a um
12:19
uh a more diverse pattern of development right where some industrial uses can be
12:24
by commercial uses and residential uses in that way that cities used to develop that was a lot more uh interesting and
12:31
sort of Jigsaw uh patterns of development rather than large blocks of
12:37
uh areas that were uniformly zoned um that being said uh it seems like CMS
12:44
is the better option because of the do um the design guidelines which are sort
12:51
of more it's definitely part of the fabric of Mage street it's it's it's it's a big part of uh
13:00
of uh what you see in your experience you know I'm just curious why did he
13:06
highlight the multif family so the significant changes between CMS and light industrial would be multif family
13:11
dwelling so that would bring one's main into conformance uh if it were transferred to
13:18
CMS then restaurant or coffee house same right current both of those currently not permitted so they're they're they're
13:25
active under special permit for those two uses right for which which uses uh multif family
13:32
dwelling and restaurant or coffee house um the coffee shop is uh there's a
13:38
reason Bruce recommended that um they don't have a they yeah um by own
13:46
understanding is the building out of use variance on the residential aspect they're both listed as not permitted in
13:52
Li so that would be correct yeah a use variant like I said once
13:59
yeah so I mean to just from that standpoint alone like what you're saying what Kevin just mentioned yeah I mean
14:04
changing to CMS makes makes sense um but I'm I am also curious then
14:10
about the eventuality that you described of you know a new build right and what
14:17
that means in terms of um dimensional issues because I agree with you I think we have to be would' have to be very
14:22
careful with a parcel like that is it I mean just want to make sure I understand correctly because I I found your
14:29
information well reason but you're saying that because of the railroad tracks separate the building footprint
14:34
from Main Street that some of the CMS requirements for having that Frontage immediately on Main Street would just
14:40
cause a a headache if you had to put something back from scratch is that well you couldn't have on Main Street because
14:45
Raad tracks be I me but so so the thing is you so you'd hit you're not going to
14:51
have Street traffic going from the sidewalk into stores and the rationale of then having a bunch of buildings that
14:58
have shared common walls maybe that makes sense maybe it
15:04
doesn't but that's sort of the presumptive development model on Main Street it's a similar I mean it's a
15:09
similar walk up except you're either coming from the parking lot or you're coming off of you know the uh East Main
15:16
you know it's the only thing is you've got the the rail if it's a rail trail too it's easier to walk across it right
15:21
I mean I you know I walk across that thing all the time and I'm afraid when they make a trail they're actually going
15:26
to put a fence up so that people like me can't do that no that'd be a bad idea they shouldn't because you want to be
15:31
able to stop your bike and get a drink at the coffee shop if you want without undo Hassle and I'm sure we'll have a
15:38
robust discussion as the trail so were there any other was that the main
15:44
concern for for the CMS or were there other ones too well the honestly the biggest thing was simply this the actual
15:50
motivating factor here is okay it doesn't allow coffee shops it doesn't
15:55
allow multif family dwellings that's in fact what is there that's consistent with current development if we're
16:02
changing to a different District that imparts right fewer use changes and it
16:10
also puts it into the same district that two very close I would say analogous
16:17
properties are in which just ranous doesn't really face on to main though and I mean I because what I find
16:23
persuasive about Kevin's argument is that you want to get your hands on the design standards for CMS because if you
16:29
did had to build something completely new on the site of one East Main you know facing Main Street across the
16:35
street you've got buildings with shops I mean aesthetically fabric wise I think
16:40
you would want to be able to capture that same Vibe and you then if you do CMS then you have all those design
16:46
requirements not that they're that robust well well said yeah I'm just
16:53
looking at some of the other changes to use retail personal service a bank remains per pered office remains
17:00
permitted artist studio art gallery exhibit space remains permitted Funeral
17:05
Home becomes not permitted where once it would have been I see that as a did you
17:12
is industrial manufacturing goes from permitted to not permitted yeah I that's I was getting to that one
17:19
arguably light manufacturing of stuff is right like breweries distilleries
17:24
workshops food preparation like those kinds of light industri uses are permitted in the CMS bar brw Pub micro
17:32
bre micro Distillery would be permitted so there are some but not not all the not as wide of a range of of industrial
17:39
did you identify other uses that you felt were specifically of concern in the trade-off between the two well
17:48
um I mean there's a whole list of things that in various respects
17:54
change let's see Social Club becomes
18:02
permitted golf course not permitted Golf Course isn't per yeah a lot of the audio
18:08
um audio auto or Auto oriented uses like a you know vehicle sales lot gas station
18:15
those would become not permited you're not going to want those yeah well those are generally currently special permit
18:21
and here's per Workshop under industrial or assembly you've got wholesale warehouse storage or Self Storage
18:27
business goes from light industrial permitted to CMS not permitted
18:33
Workshop permitted permitted and then industrial or manufacturing use um Li
18:39
permitted CMS not permitted I think that makes sense a nursery
18:47
becomes not permitted Horticultural Nursery permitted
18:56
to it goes from from pered right oh private school or Nursery goes to not permitted oh here we are private tennis
19:04
court or pool parking structure becomes permitted
19:09
I'm not sure I like that Garden roof or Greenhouse where where do you see
19:16
Nursery or under other educational yeah private school private school or Nursery
19:22
School becomes not permitted parking structure as an
19:28
accessory use however does become a permitted use in
19:36
CMS permitted accessory uses yep incidental to permitted
19:43
principle but not an activity for commercial gain okay in a residential district that doesn't apply
19:49
here I mean another option too would just be to tweak the LI use regulations
19:55
I don't really know that there's any reason we need to be prohibiting coffee shop
20:00
in the other areas that have that that's a that's a fair observation I mean also like
20:07
the fixing the fewest things approach yeah I don't know I mean can we can
20:13
we add multif family right yeah I mean to the LI District the
20:21
use but they've got hey Jen do you know when they're planning on taking this up for a vote I do not do you
20:31
1 this coming
20:38
up I love how they spring these things on us jeez you really want to have multif family in late
20:45
industrial well the only places that are really left after this there's one or two Tiny Places off fish kill Avenue and
20:55
then everything else is down by the river um a lot of stuff that doesn't really
21:02
seem yeah yeah not particularly
21:10
usable yeah um I we're only dealing with the one person I just think that if that that
21:17
option of like allowing multif family and Li would require a little bit
21:23
more I think that would require some more analysis I think that's what you're asking about timing right to just look a little bit more at all the lii districts
21:30
and I'm all for mixing you know like moving towards more mixed use districts but I
21:38
do feel like the CMS District does that right that was kind of the intent of the CMS District was to allow some
21:45
lighter industrial I I don't know I wonder if it really comes down to like the definition of industrial
21:50
manufacturing right because that's the one big one that's permitted in Li not permitted in CMS so like what are we losing
21:57
between those two i i a brewery seems like a hard fit to
22:03
Industrial a manufacturing to me but again it's its own listed use here
22:09
distinct to uh he either heavy or even light industrial um so yeah I mean I
22:15
think the only thing just to kind of summarize because we're not going to have time for the best part of the
22:22
conversation um the other local law we'll have to do that afterwards but um
22:28
is to say that uh you know I'm I'm still going back to um this
22:36
idea of what the dimensional impact is
22:41
in change of District between light light industrial and CMS and and then what what what potential full
22:50
build um impact that has on this particular
22:56
lot right I don't I just don't know what that is I don't think any of us do so we
23:02
don't really have enough on that specifically when we talk only about
23:07
uses yeah it it does make sense but what the ultimate potential looks like for that lot as CMS
23:17
is not clear and we'd we'd rather have more information on that right I mean we have the schedule of dimensional
23:22
regulations which we can look at um well we got a few minutes the time
23:28
time to really analyze we got 5 minutes there's a 1500 ft minimum lot size in Li
23:34
there's no minimum lot size in CMS that's a change there is a 20ft sidey
23:40
yard requirement in Li it's zero in CMS yeah and there is 20% minimum open space
23:48
in Li but 10% in CMS and there's some other differences here and there but I'd say that's the high point those are
23:55
significant what can you go through the GB um regulations GB does not have any
24:01
uh open space so that's going the other way however it's also a 1500 ft minimum lot size and it's also a 20ft side yard
24:12
requirement so it's the dimensional restrictions are a lot closer at least
24:18
as compared with CMS now like I said from a planning lot size but minimum lot area per unit so
24:25
like that's just speaking to uming so there's no minimum lot size Li is
24:31
minimum 60 wide 100 ft deep G I thought had asked about GB right GB to CMS
24:38
neither has a minimum lot size uh no GB has a minimum lot size of,
24:44
1500 per unit per unit lot area yeah it's there's no minimum lot width in GB
24:50
it's 100 ft in depth it's 60 by 100 in Li and then it's 0 by 75 in CMS no
24:58
minimum you could have you could have a 5,000 ft lot there's no minimum lot size but if you're putting residential on
25:03
there you have to have, 1500 ft per that you're putting on there so it does limit density in a way that CMS does
25:11
not right that's the 1500 yeah so that's that's another impactful I'm I think that the the
25:19
comparison with the GB is more compelling you know I think that the the broader uses allowed given the location
25:27
of the of the the site and should it be blown over in a hurricane um you know
25:32
the size of the lot I think I agree about the diversity of uses and and
25:38
mixed use I understand the um the um the
25:43
design standards not being applied in the GB but uh you know I think we have
25:49
dealt with lots like the one on 52 across from the gas station Fair like we
25:57
didn't have such strict design guidelines on that in the transitional Zone and you know we make the best of it
26:04
wasn't that great though my opinion making the best of it takes a lot of energy the result is not super thrilling
26:10
yeah no I so here's here's what I would say feel like the design guidelines for the CMS are you know it's a materiality
26:17
in the direction of the windows I mean I know it's something it's something not a lot it's it's then it's all about the
26:24
trade-off right I mean here given that we have only a couple minutes left in our Workshop I mean I'd rather see a
26:30
diversity of uses yeah I what I would say to the council respectfully is when
26:37
it comes to use a switch from Li to GMS seems
26:43
appropriate however it is it's not clear and we would suggest you look more closely
26:50
at uh those other issues that we just described um yeah the Lots the a lot
26:58
setbacks are are that's a big issue and density because you know what I'm hearing is is that there is a potential
27:04
for greater density in GMS in CMS CMS in CMS yeahh so that could be a potential
27:10
issue as well you know unintended
27:16
consequences um so for all intented purposes we're sharing that we we
27:21
believe that there is more study of this
27:26
necessary before City another thing I don't know that they've looked at the comprehensive plan
27:33
just to make sure that there's nothing in the comprehensive plan that would speak directly to you know to Kevin's
27:38
point you know retaining A diversity of you know allowing industrial uses and a
27:43
diversity of economic you know generators I think it's wise to point them back to the
27:49
comprehensive plan always to make sure I would be surprised if Lee weren't thinking comprehensive plan but I'm sure
27:56
he uses it as his Bible Natalie were you um in were you advising
28:02
the city council directly or is this can we have your input here yeah yeah I'm
28:07
sure the council I could give it to both you and the council in terms of the change um happy to look at I I
28:14
mean I think David started a good analysis of kind of comparing the various districts and the options like I
28:19
will just say you still do get a diversity of uses in the CMS like it is one of the most diverse in terms of like
28:24
the uses our but I think doing a little comparison adding G into that right so looking at Li to CMS to GB could be a
28:31
good analysis yeah yeah in terms of dimention and uses not
28:37
just not just use yep yeah wow we did good we landed right on
28:45
7:30 so that brings us to our regular agenda welcome everybody to the March
28:50
2025 meeting of the city of Beacon planning board uh we are going to begin
28:57
our business with uh we have minutes to approve from last
29:02
month um are there any changes that we need to uh
29:11
memorialize no so as is motion to um
29:17
enter last month's meeting notes into the record motion motion by David second
29:23
second second by Kevin all in favor I I I let's
29:29
see so that brings us to our first agenda item uh which is uh to continue
29:35
public hearing for secret and site plan approval and continue the review of an
29:40
application for site plan and subdivision approval mixed use commercial and residential 45 beakman
29:45
Street High Street and High Street submitted by beakman Arts Center LLC and Bay rid Studios LLC good evening good
29:53
evening Mr chairman for the record Taylor Palmer with the law firm of cudy and fader on behalf of the applicant I'm joined by our project architect ra
29:59
seagull as well as Justin dates and Rich uh Deandrea both from colar as you laid
30:04
out Mr chairman we are before you for our continued site plan and secret public hearings uh in connection with our proposal to redevelop the property
30:10
for two four story mixed use commercial and and multif family residential buildings to be located at 45 beakman uh
30:16
and high streets uh we did provide a comprehensive summary of the project uh at our February meeting with the public
30:22
hearing was opened and at this time we'll provide just an overview of the supplemental submission that we made to you all uh on
30:28
February 25th before turning it over to ARA and Justin to kind of walk through some of those uh minor site plan updates
30:34
specifically the site plans have been adjusted to include uh some updates related to the size of the Water Service
30:39
connection to the building uh the location of certain storm pipes and the layout uh proposed to under drain bio
30:45
retention area and the architectural plans uh have included certain site sections to reflect the uh current
30:51
grading and proposed plantings with the current building design uh additional changes include uh some adjustments to
30:57
the roof on the beakman building uh to conceal the rooftop mechanical equipment and then screening on all sides to help
31:03
Shield potential views uh from Neighbors and passers by the supplemental submission also addressed certain public
31:08
comments from the February 11th meeting including those retaining to the uh retaining to the retaining wall uh at
31:15
the joining High Street property uh just overiew this shortly in a moment um but only a temporary excavation for the
31:21
drainage structure will be um completed on the site so no other excavation or removing of uh the existing slope
31:28
adjacent to the base of the walls proposed and then we have storm water mitigation measures uh designed to
31:33
significantly decrease uh any potential impacts to that area so those were some of the just the minor updates based on
31:40
uh the feedback from the last meeting at this point I'll turn it over uh to ARA to walk through the changes to the site
31:46
plan and then have Justin kind of walk you through some of those comments
32:03
good evening um yeah so as Taylor said we submitted some updated drawings based
32:08
on the comments we received at the last meeting um one of one of the things that we
32:14
talked about was the lighting for the arcade so we added a ceiling plan that
32:20
shows how that lighting Works um we're basically dividing it up into little
32:26
coford Bays and then light fixtures would be you know within those that those would be some pendant fixtures um
32:35
and we uh submitted the type it's just a a simple globe and and then on on the
32:43
each column we we also showed the lighting uh fixture it it's like a just a decorative
32:51
up and down fixture um do you have an example of it here cut
32:59
sheet the the light fixture yeah hold
33:05
on hold on let me just see what drawing is that is that was that part of the Architectural
33:11
Review which applied lighting fixtures we we talked about it at the at the last
33:16
meeting just to get a better idea
33:32
thank you uh for the for the record for the
33:37
recording ARA handed me cut sheet of the thorn lighting and
33:42
noted that these will be indicated on the
33:49
drawings um then then we also looked at the um roof plan for each building and
33:56
how we're going to enclose the mechanical equipment that's up there so it on on the 45 beakman building it's
34:04
going to be screened with uh you know like a perforated screening material
34:10
which would help with the Acoustics of it as well can you show us
34:16
that uh I got I got to say um you know these
34:22
rooftop mechanical units they're ubiquitous now they seem to end up on every project what whatever but for
34:30
every single application I don't necessarily mean to paint you with the broad brush this
34:36
application but I I just have to note for the record every single application where we've talked about rooftop
34:43
mechanical units sight lines we've always promised that they're going to be shielded no one's ever going to see them
34:49
and then lo and behold we find out that you know they're visible they're shielded you can still see them through
34:55
the shielding so I want to make sure that we cover this in great detail yeah
35:00
this is when we took a little closer look at you can see that there's um that that
35:06
rooftop um screened enclosure contains you know both the override for the
35:11
elevator and and then just continues around um on all four sides to screen the equipment so so the equipment is
35:18
well below that and what is the what is the material you're using for this screening
35:23
that that one's a like a perforated um metal is that something you could share a sample of yeah yeah I'll get that
35:32
please and then are you is this enclosure does this have a roof on it
35:38
no what's that sort of dark is it just a cap coping up top yeah that that's just
35:43
to to finish it
35:49
out and that's the only location you have rooftop mechanical units yeah that
35:54
that that would fit um all the condensers for the building and is do you include a roofing plan a roof plan
36:02
yeah showing the location of these units
36:08
mhm uh yeah that that's something we added here it's you can see the units in
36:13
that little square and then next to it is the uh you know the elevator and
36:18
they're not going to magically move during construction I mean no the the the the
36:24
reason we're doing that is to take care of that issue because I I I I know it comes up um on on on the
36:32
other on the smaller building what we're doing is creating a little cutout in the roof so we're we're going to have a
36:39
similar thing they're they're just sort of buried in the in the roof construction so you you wouldn't be able
36:45
to see them so wait describe that again what are you talking about uh let me just get that plan a little bigger
37:14
okay so you know how we have that that little system of gable roof and Dormers
37:20
up up on top of the building near High Street um so what what we're going to do
37:25
is in the middle there we we're going to carve a little sunken area out of that
37:31
roof system and and those um the mechanical equipment would be in there
37:36
so it you know it's like four or five ft below the roof Peak so you wouldn't see
37:42
that either you have an elevation of
37:48
that um it I mean it's really it's it's not different than
37:54
the building elevation um
38:02
I mean you know basically it's it's buried behind the the Gable system
38:10
there so so you wouldn't really yeah you know I mean you're you're you're looking at it here
38:16
um but but it's all you know because it's below the high points of the roof
38:21
um it it's a recessed little area so those things are never seing from the
38:29
street or even above what about views from High Street I know you've shared sections but like for example somebody
38:37
at the third story of one of their old victorians up on High Street they're going to be able to look down on top of
38:43
this and see units I don't think you'd see the
38:49
units that because they're buried far enough in in this recess you you you would see you know
38:56
you'd see the roof system but not the mechanical
39:02
units all right we'll leave that I'm still I'm still super concerned especially from you know views on High
39:08
Street yeah you know I know you've showed sections and I know we've talked about this in the past but these sections are
39:14
generic just relative to you know really understanding some of
39:20
the some of the actual views MH from High Street
39:27
we'll just leave that there for the moment then okay I mean if it's helpful I could also do a a building section
39:35
that shows how that recess works I think it would be helpful yeah
39:40
cuz you know again unfortunately you're feeling the hurt from it but we've been burned before yeah no I understand and I
39:48
think you will see the rooftops from High Street I think you will the upper stories for sure you you you'll see rooftop but you
39:56
won't see the units all right I it would be it' be best for us to have comp confidence in that yeah
40:03
I understand thank
40:12
you um yes so while while we're here we also updated the site sections to show a
40:20
little bit more of what's happening with the proposed Landscaping how it relates to the existing land landcaping we're
40:28
we're we're also showing the um that little retaining wall um that is on the
40:36
boundary of the properties um Justin can talk about that a little bit more but it's um we're actually building up in
40:43
that area so we're not doing anything to undermine that wall I'm seeing I'm seeing this exhibit
40:50
that you shared this wall exhibit is that intended to describe the extent of the grading you're doing
40:56
adjacent to the wall this guy oh um
41:01
yeah okay all right when we get to it yeah we'll get to that one are we going to get to that H are we going to get to
41:09
that wall and that's later okay oh yeah um okay so then we
41:16
also between the last meeting uh and now
41:21
there was more discussion with Central Hudson about the utility poll at the corner so it it it looks that would be
41:27
very difficult to move um so I'm I'm going to incorporate that into the into
41:33
the views so can you know see how that works and we we'll see if we can incorporate it into the design any
41:40
better but but you know we're talking about possibly moving that utility poll but that looks like it's going to be
41:45
very difficult yeah yeah I'm thinking back to last month's sort of side by side yeah that Natalie put together yeah
41:54
and and and and we'll add that to our rendering so you can you know see see the
42:00
relationship did you have something yeah just well on that topic if the mechanical equipment on the High Street
42:06
Building can be sort of nestled within the roof line uh why can't the same thing be done on the other building
42:12
rather than having that enclosure projecting above the roof so
42:17
dramatically I think we we had talked as a board about how the the upper story of
42:23
the building at the corner of peakman and and uh 9d had kind of a an unobtrusive sort of
42:31
light look to it and then now you know you've got this massive enclosure on top of it like a kind of kills
42:38
that that well it was either um you know basically what we were trying to do is
42:44
address both of those issues you know there there had to be some projection above the roof line for the elevator
42:50
bulkhead and then in order not to make it just you know it its own little thing
42:57
there we we sort of took that added the um mechanical equipment just made one
43:03
element out of it to try to simplify it yeah I mean just going back to to that element on the on the Eastern Building
43:10
the larger building M um you understand your approach I will say it you know it
43:16
continues to evolve and it continues to be reminiscent of of somewhat of an
43:24
afterthought you know just in terms of the overall composition so to some degree you know I'm in
43:30
support of what I think Len was alluding to is some further study for how that
43:37
thing can become less um disjointed just relative to the
43:44
overal composition in addition to obviously doing the job of shielding the unsightly
43:50
mechanical units yeah yeah I mean I mean you know the as as the problem has
43:58
arisen you know if if there's nothing there then you can see them you know so
44:03
so it really the the the screen itself is going to have presence there I know I know so what what what you're saying is
44:10
because yeah because of there we have to screen them right so you're going to see something that's screening them right
44:17
what I'm saying I think lens also leading toward that is is that let's let's do what we can to screen them the
44:25
best we can right visually and aesthetically mhm okay yeah I we
44:31
can continue to look at that but yeah
44:37
okay uh let's see what else there is yeah I mean I mean that that was sort of
44:42
the uh awesome the basic updates on the building side thanks
44:55
okay yeah good evening Justin dates colle years's engineering and design so from our last uh submission I'll give a
45:03
few updates that we provided uh one was there was a handful of comments uh from Mr Russo's uh letter that we addressed
45:09
that were coordinated uh water utilities sizing uh some uh updates or more
45:15
detailing on the bio retention area and underd drain things of that nature that we provided on the uh the updated plans
45:22
uh and responded to those comments we also uh we had a meeting uh
45:28
at the site with Central Hudson uh as we had uh mentioned last time that was being scheduled uh we met them on site
45:35
to review the existing utility polls uh there's really three uh that we looked at that would be impacted by the project
45:42
uh one is on the very western side of the site near High Street uh a pole was
45:48
placed for a service for I believe the the PRI you know Contractor Yard uh that
45:53
was there uh so that one there's no issue with that being removed as we have proposed on the site plans uh there's a
46:00
second one that's about Midway of the uh the beakman uh building on that north
46:05
side of beakman street uh which right now Falls uh a few feet within the
46:11
footprint of that beakman building so we we did propose relocation of that uh
46:16
pole uh and reviewing it in the field with Central Hudson that one would really need to be moved to the south
46:22
side of beakman and we are continuing our discussion with with them on how that would would work which one is that
46:29
so it's it's about it's about Midway uh yeah right where the cursor is right about there
46:36
there's an existing utility pole on our side of the uh the street there not the one on the corner that AR was just no
46:42
that was my next one I was going to I was going to mention so the one you just mentioned is being relocated yes and
46:48
based on uh Central Hudson that would need to go to the uh south side of beak bin so we're reviewing that with
46:55
them and you're reviewing the the final location yeah where where that location
47:00
would work in coordination with how it connects to the uh the the uh down Downstream poles and Upstream poles the
47:07
dumb question but I got to ask um if it's if it's feasible to move that pole
47:14
how come it's not feasible to move the other pole so the pole on the corner you're speaking so that pole has uh
47:21
overhead wires are coming in all four directions so in order to relocate that
47:26
one uh and based on our discussion in the field you're talking about reigning
47:32
you know a poll or more in conjunction with those upstream or Downstream uh overhead connections uh
47:40
they explained it as you know very significant uh to undertake uh and it seems like where the
47:47
poll is now and how it works with the uh the corner there um I think that what
47:54
we've done with that Plaza and how we've expanded the sidewalk it's not necessarily uh an interference or or or
48:02
uh you know a bad impact to the circulation through there because of you know the expanse of the sidewalk that
48:08
we're doing and how we're getting into the building and things of that nature so um with that you know we're we were
48:13
not looking to relocate that pole just because of you know the severe level of effort that was you know
48:21
uh unfortunate you got our hopes up last meeting I'm sorry if I did that but all
48:27
right we we did it we did talk about it with them so understood thanks okay anything else uh yes one thing uh we
48:34
also did provide in the the uh regarding the retaining wall so we that map that you just held up uh before uh had that
48:42
was part of our uh updated submission when you kind of described the scenario of the site improvements that are going
48:47
on adjacent to that wall that the um the resident at 16 High Street uh has had presented last time y so uh within the
48:55
vicinity of the wall uh and what that blowup shows is our proposed grading and improvements uh
49:03
we'll start with the grading actually we tie into uh the elevations uh before the
49:08
base of that wall um and then as you uh go south of that right we are filling
49:15
that that area Okay uh so we're not Excavating or taking away material from
49:21
the base of that wall uh you know which could lead to undermining uh of a retaining wall um um we are actually
49:28
filling up that area the slope there is you know maybe a a one on three or you
49:33
know uh maybe a one on two in some instances we're actually you know leveling that area out based on some of
49:40
the improvements that are going there adjacent to the wall uh We've also proposed a uh
49:46
drainage swell at the base uh and we do have a a catch Basin there that's the
49:52
one temporary excavation that we have near the wall uh to put in catch Basin and that's where the Swale would tie in
49:58
for drainage at the base so we do uh overall we believe we're improving you know the drainage in that area uh with
50:06
with the uh development improvements uh as well as you know curbing parking things of that nature
50:12
Are all uh quite removed from that wall itself so what you're saying is that
50:18
these Contours are redirecting this is intended to direct water
50:24
away oh sorry yeah so that drain in that there is is
50:29
the low Point yeah so oh water's going in that direction catching yeah we're catching this is
50:34
a and this is the so this is that's catching the water at the Bas getting
50:41
it's been collected okay the highlighted elevations on there
50:49
are the uh the difference in grade is that what you're adding the yellow yes
50:55
so if it's basically all plus so that shows you how much fill is being placed
51:00
uh from existing grade to proposed grade so you can see that they're all um you know on an average in this particular
51:08
area you know 4 feet or so uh that area is getting raised up plus or
51:17
minus yep thank you you're welcome can I yep anything more why is this so close
51:25
to the wall and what kind of equipment are you going to use to excavate uh the the U drainage assembly
51:33
you know what I'm saying it would be an excavator I again it's a shallow right
51:38
it's only about 4T deep for that structure I believe no I concern yeah my concern about this layout is that it's
51:46
like 3 ft is well within the ability of a of a back ho to make a mistake and
51:53
wreck the wall right which wouldn't probably withstand a lot of damage from or a lot of
51:59
pressure from a a piece of mechanical equipment and I just it seems like if
52:07
you just place this you know about three more or four more feet away you could
52:12
achieve the same result and does this the other question I had was is
52:18
this uh just taking surface water does this need to get put into the uh uh
52:24
detention or retention uh structure this does not no this is surface water
52:30
uh that's being that's the low point and it's tied into the the site drainage system that goes west and and it's doing
52:39
what as far as um it's removing a potential ponding issue that could occur
52:45
there at the base but that's all sloped right now right creating a yeah we're
52:50
creating a swell based on how we're filling adjacent to as I've described well since you're I'm just curious how
52:57
much do you actually have to excav well you have to excavate for the connection I mean to uh you know what
53:03
I'm saying to to Kevin's Point could that uh draining that could we shift that a little further away from wall I
53:09
mean we could look at that that's a possibility save a couple if the concern is I mean we're still like 4 feet away
53:15
from from that wall yeah but that's like it's you know I can reach four feet with my hands sure sure I mean obviously
53:22
there's some level of safety and things that have to be implored on the excavators and when you excavate right
53:29
there's a certain uh angle of uh the hole or whatever that is the angle of uh
53:34
for a 4 foot it's not as yeah it's not required as significantly as a deeper
53:40
I'm I'm concerned that there wasn't any reason or I'm not I'm cons if there's a
53:45
if there's he he already mentioned that there's a possibility of moving a little bit further away from the wall or away
53:54
from the wall enough to eliminate concern for some potential accident
53:59
involving a backhoe can you move it towards the towards where the two walls come together at the point so that he's
54:08
got this he's got this pad in the way he can still the pad on top oh yeah it
54:13
could yeah or it could be there's a potential that could be on the opposite side of that so that's something you
54:19
taking a look at that thank you you like us to are there other sort of drainage assemblies that are less disruptive
54:25
don't require as excavation then this is like a cast iron I'm guessing right yeah it's a it's
54:33
a small yard uh yard drain it's like a 2X two it's not even like a like the
54:38
street ones are much larger 4x4 just a smaller like yard Inlet um but we could look at both of those
54:45
instances for you thank you sure great anything else
54:51
like me to address not for the moment great we may come back to you all right thank you
54:59
do you have anything else as far as your presentation okay so um we'll go to our
55:04
engineer and planner in that order then board we want to talk amongst ourselves in advance of going to the
55:12
public because we do have um a um draft neag deck on secra but we
55:19
want to spend some time with that and I think we should do it um prior to offering the public their um ability to
55:26
comment just so that they have that in addition our discussion around secra um
55:32
to be able to ingest and comment on so with that we'll go to John thank
55:40
you so we still have a number of comments that are outstanding that um
55:46
the applicant can't address yet until they have finalized any land swapping with do or the acquisition of the land
55:52
from do um so working on that we still have
55:58
questions with regards to some of the utilities um specifically the residents
56:04
on Tomkins whether they're tied into this sanitary that runs through the site or not um we also have uh some revisions
56:13
that need to be done with regards to the uh sanitary that's on site at
56:19
present um we are still waiting for an analysis of the existing condition of
56:25
the sour that runs across beakman street itself um they're in the process of scheduling that
56:31
work um with regards to storm water uh pollution prevention plan they have
56:38
submitted a plan that does work they need to do some soil testing uh to
56:44
continue that and they also need to update that Swip now to the new construction uh General permit that was
56:50
issued in January okay okay thanks John any um
56:58
questions for the engineer I think we got it all right um my comment there not much of
57:06
this submission um I think the submission focused a lot on the utilities and kind of that those sheets
57:11
of the plan set I think my major overarching comment is the board has been reviewing this application for over
57:19
a year now and I think we've been getting pieces of revision so now that we're getting towards the end of what
57:25
you guys you know asking for seet determinations and potential approvals it would be good to have the full site plan set right have the full set
57:32
Together full architecture set I think that'll allow us to do a more comprehensive review uh to make sure that everything is consistent and lining
57:39
up um and that everything we discussed in previous meetings has been retained and carried over for the final set so I
57:45
think that would be that would help with my review for the next meeting um and then to that point I think there was a
57:51
comment about the lighting I had been requesting the building lighting being shown I know we did have a layout of
57:56
that kind of added to one of the elevations uh but in the thread of my previous comment adding that to the
58:02
living plan spec sheet that we kind of showed tonight just putting that all in one place so all the information's in
58:08
the official set that's going to be reviewed and approved or decided on top and Tails as they say oh yeah
58:16
yeah um okay and then I think we I have some other comments and but I think we'll get into them when we get into
58:22
Seeker about kind of going through some of the stuff that we heard in the public comment yeah uh period uh last month but
58:28
I think we'll kind of touch on that as we move through the Seeker review yeah so again we do have the draft neg deck
58:34
and I think we want to look closely at a couple of the sections um traffic Community character
58:42
um there may be others uh as Natalie mentioned so do you want to maybe start
58:47
us off Jennifer just in a review of the the neg deck and where we're at at the moment sure um so uh either last month
58:55
or the month before we had prepared the eaf part two uh for your review so you do have that uh and for this month we
59:04
prepared the draft part three so negative declaration um one thing I just want to note up at the top is the neg
59:12
deck uh narrative does uh indicate that the proposed action is an unlisted
59:17
action um I was reminded today that back in November while the unlisted action
59:24
classification was true at the start of the application it actually changed to a type one action in November when um
59:32
shipo deemed the High Street historic district to be eligible for listing on the national register that then elevated
59:40
the unlisted action to a type one action based on the scope of the project and it's um uh the fact that it's contiguous
59:48
to that eligible District so we're now in a type one action uh because of that
59:55
um the analysis Remains the Same as far as the impacts are concerned though so
1:00:02
um you mentioned a couple of sections that you wanted to go through so I'm going to skip you know we analyzed in
1:00:09
the neg deck every category in the the eaf part two um but we won't go through
1:00:15
each and every one of those one that I think we should highlight is the impact on historic resources that's on page
1:00:22
eight of the neg deck um the project is located in
1:00:28
proximity to the DWI house and the lower Main Street historic district but it is kind somewhat removed from those two
1:00:35
historic resources um that the DWI house would not have views of this uh from
1:00:41
that property uh nor would it from the the lower Main Street historic district however as I mentioned the High Street
1:00:49
uh Tomkins Avenue historic district is a district that is eligible for listing on the national register so um views from
1:00:56
High Street should be taken into consideration and I know we looked at that a little bit uh and talked about
1:01:02
that a little bit earlier in the meeting um I know the applicant had mentioned that they are in the process of
1:01:07
preparing a rendering that would um show those views um my understanding is that rendering was not available for
1:01:14
tonight's meeting but hopefully that will be available for for your next meeting because I think that's going to be important to um for your
1:01:21
analysis um and then a portion of the the property is located in the HDO District
1:01:29
um the portion uh sort of on the corner of High and beakman um where the former
1:01:36
contractor's yard used to be in that location so um that is relevant as
1:01:43
well um transportation I'll move to Transportation unless there's
1:01:49
any I was going to say on the shipo when you guys are preparing the view shed do we have um consultation with shipo as
1:01:56
well through the Chris system we do and we're following up with them as well okay perfect if we can include that in
1:02:01
the submission that' be great thank you um so for transportation obviously
1:02:07
you know the applicant submitted a traffic impact study um that's been reviewed by crane Manning your
1:02:13
professional traffic consultant um the neg deck outlines the one two three five
1:02:20
five intersections that were studied in the traffic impact study uh 90 ver plank
1:02:26
90 in Tomkins Avenue and Ralph Street 90 in beakman Street and West Church um 90
1:02:34
and Main Street Municipal Plaza and beakman Street and High Street the uh
1:02:39
traffic study didn't only include the traffic to be generated by this project but also built in the traffic levels for
1:02:46
projects that have been approved in the area but not yet built so for example um
1:02:52
Edgewater uh well Edgewater is partially built uh beakman Commons which is the 16 West Main Street um project that was
1:02:59
approved several years ago for about 60 something units um it included prophecy theater the 1113 walcot 364 Maine and
1:03:08
miru Beacon so all the traffic from those projects were built in um the applicant
1:03:15
also studied at the request of the planning board the possible addition of a southbound right turn lane that
1:03:22
analysis is included in the neg deck and ultim Ely um there were a number of
1:03:28
mitigation measures that were identified um to be included in the project the
1:03:34
traffic impact study demonstrated that the intersection at 9d and beakman in
1:03:39
West Church Street um while it has current operational constraints um
1:03:45
during the study periods those constraints are going to be exacerbated in the build conditions so for that
1:03:52
reason there are some um mitigation measures that are proposed those include
1:03:57
uh traffic signal phasing and timing modifications um for that particular
1:04:03
intersection as well as the intersection at Main Street and Municipal Plaza um so
1:04:08
that those are coordinated um as well also as continued monitoring of the route 9d and Tomkins
1:04:15
Avenue intersection and if you remember this is the same mitigation measure and
1:04:20
condition that we've put on a number of projects that have been approved in this area um to have a post occupancy
1:04:28
monitoring um uh study done this was for Edgewater this was for
1:04:34
um I believe it was for 16 West Main um and another project which is uh escaping
1:04:41
me at this moment um but on a number of projects this has been a condition that that you've imposed that at about 6
1:04:48
months to 12 months after full occupancy the applicant is required to study that intersection to see whether
1:04:56
uh a signal warrant has been tripped uh to necessitate a signal and then that would
1:05:02
trigger all of the projects to contribute their fair share towards the
1:05:07
cost of installing a signal at that particular intersection I'm just curious the first one to roll in on that is
1:05:13
going to be Edgewater right um probably yeah do we
1:05:18
know how far off they might be from completion and then clock ticking on
1:05:24
study I don't don't know I don't know if Corey knows um if Edgewater is close to their
1:05:32
last Co yeah just how close you think we are if you know if you know so with Edge
1:05:39
there's like you already said there's three buildings that are fully seed they're about 80% occupancy um we just
1:05:45
issued the foundation and footing permits for buildings three and four um not to go up with framing yet but um
1:05:53
those are at least started so you're still a ways away want to put a timeline on it but it's moving but it's still got
1:05:59
some time to go still ways away thank you um so the other thing that's addressed in the transportation section
1:06:05
is parking um the number of off street parking spaces provided on site increased as a result of your review and
1:06:11
the review of the your um your traffic consultant so I believe it's 91 if I've
1:06:18
read the materials correct 91 spaces are currently proposed in the garage and the surface parking um at at the
1:06:27
site um and then I guess the last section
1:06:33
that I think is probably most relevant is the last uh which is the consistency with Community plans and Community
1:06:38
character um and you'll see in that section of the neg deck there's a lot of references to and quotes from the
1:06:44
comprehensive plan and the purposes um of the L District the linkage District was which was created really to link the
1:06:52
Waterfront and Main Street um through residential and sort of Street
1:06:58
activating uses um and the fact that the applicant is um pursuing a right of way
1:07:05
acquisition from New York state do really helps with that activation because it's going to allow the building
1:07:12
to be um front and center along the street rather than tucked back where their current property line is ma um I
1:07:20
should remember because I was on the committee I think with Kevin for comp plan back in when was that a 100 years
1:07:27
ago 2007 0507 but yeah um just in terms of you
1:07:34
know this application as it stands you know being
1:07:40
compliant with the comp plan are we as a city comfortable confident that that is
1:07:46
the case yeah and I think I think there's some important parts I mean the language there was then from that
1:07:52
comprehensive plan was like codified uh in the linkage District zoning so a lot of that similar language about
1:07:57
encouraging higher density residential um specifically along this Corridor
1:08:02
connecting Main Street I think is is kind of the stated intent of the linkage District I think that is where I thought
1:08:08
it would be a good opportunity to maybe have the applicant go through some additional talk you know like I said
1:08:14
we've been talking about this for a long time so I think there's some points within the linkage District that we
1:08:19
could talk about a little bit further in response to reminding kind of the architectural nods cuz we did a lot of
1:08:25
discussion during the ARB um sessions that came back here but speaking to right the code is very specific that new
1:08:32
construction does not need to match historic buildings right but there's allowance for contemporary architectural
1:08:39
flexibility um that is however kind of appropriately relates to Historic and I think there's a lot of discussion of
1:08:45
that I think that would be good to have the applicant go over again and then one piece one point that I wanted to point
1:08:50
out that I know came up in public comment was about materiality um and I think your request
1:08:56
for samples uh of the materials would be really helpful either even if it's a digital sample board having that I think
1:09:02
is helpful um but I did want to put that question to the applicant because there is um I think this project is proposing
1:09:09
metal panels um there is language in the code that specifically Outlaws sheet metal um and I wanted an architect to
1:09:16
kind of speak to that in terms of what you feel the difference is between what's being proposed here and what's in the code what about also glass walls or
1:09:24
you know things that are approaching all you know and we've had this discussion for other buildings but there's that
1:09:30
that comment about um you know mirrored reflective or tinted glass and All Glass Walls except green houses shall not be
1:09:37
permitted in the HD we had a little bit of this with the building on on the corner of Maine and
1:09:43
shank because uh all is a probably should have been there
1:09:49
probably should have been a percentage of glass if they really wanted to control it and just to be clear the prop the buildings are not located generally
1:09:56
speaking within the HD themselves there's just a corner of the property that is zoned that way and there had been a building there oh sorry I was
1:10:03
referring to the linkage District but I think what what Len is bringing up is and there is language about um full full
1:10:09
glass walls I think I'll have to look find that in here but I was more I was going to kind of give you guys the
1:10:14
opportunity to speak to that since I know that came up um and then also I
1:10:19
think the one thing that I would recommend maybe adding to the um to the convers ation within the neg deck is
1:10:27
linkage district is very unique in that it talks about kind of this division of the public space in front of a building
1:10:32
right there's the building transition there's The Pedestrian clearway and then there's the street transition and
1:10:38
there's various requirements for each one of those sections and we talked a lot about that at the very beginning of
1:10:43
of this uh review of this site plan I think um there's ability for to encourage kind of certain materials
1:10:50
within that street um transition and we talked a lot about that so I think that would be good to also integrate that
1:10:56
conversation because I believe where we landed on that was because of I'll let the engineers speak to this because I think that's what it ultimately came
1:11:03
down to but um because of utilities um safe distances and things
1:11:08
like that that it wasn't practical to put Street trees and benches within the
1:11:13
street transition as is encouraged by the code but instead that got moved adjacent to the building um and if you
1:11:19
could speak to that and how you feel like that still addresses kind of the intent of the linkage of providing those
1:11:25
amenities for pedestrians along beatman so that those are my comments a lot of them tied into that but I do I think the
1:11:31
general comprehensive plan and the linkage District are definitely looking for higher density higher density than
1:11:38
what is maybe historically are currently their residential along this Corridor um this is one of the areas that that's
1:11:44
been identified for in the city uh versus others so I do think it is addressing that intent headon okay thank
1:11:51
you did you get all that I think I I think I did it's yeah it is and and I I know we're going
1:11:58
to put in a supplemental submission all to to you all but I can certainly start to try and Chip through some of that if if the board sees fit I know we have
1:12:04
public comments tonight but um would you like me to I I yeah I mean we've included this material I think
1:12:09
importantly I think the neg the draft negative declaration you know accounts for a lot of what we've submitted and it
1:12:15
sort of it reflects back on all those materials I think Natalie's initial point was get me the full plan set Sue
1:12:20
that we can you know show that's point one proofs in the proofs in the putting but beyond that we have done a lot of
1:12:26
work with the architecture there was a question about the type of metal we'll certainly have ra addressed that and I think we have to work probably with the
1:12:31
building department to make any sort of determination related to the specific subsection um it did steal you I was I
1:12:37
was going to make my British joke aluminium um depending on what there is a specific explicit prohibition on those
1:12:43
those types of metal but certain recommendations from the Architectural Review subcommittee did encourage the
1:12:49
the uses right so the the the materials so we could do and I'll just get there L we could utilize something like a Hardy
1:12:54
Board there are ways to address those things not that the board would necessarily want that so as a consequence we're trying to interject
1:13:00
one thing because we we did have a little bit of a precedent for this discussion and it was a different District but when we reviewed when we
1:13:06
did the airb review for 2328 Creek Drive which was in The Fish Co Creek Zone there was a similar prohibition on on
1:13:13
metal siding which was brought up during the ARB and at the time you know for what it's worth John Clark went back and
1:13:21
and said you know I I know the intent of what was written mhm at at that point and it was to prevent like corated
1:13:27
siding so he so he said you know if we're dealing with an architectural project you know product it's a it's she
1:13:34
metal product that's like going back to the uh founding fathers for the original reading it's to L to lens's point the
1:13:41
code explicitly says or other material deemed acceptable by the planning board so it there's there is a we're not
1:13:47
trying to open that discussion more detail tonight we're going to address it we do need to work with the building department to make sure it fits I think
1:13:53
that is a good example that Len brought up but we're going to make sure that whatever is used would either be permissive or we'd have to seek
1:13:59
ultimately a variance if we didn't change that material if if it's deem that this can't be done and that would
1:14:04
be the process there I'm just I'm just astounded by lens's memory I was quite
1:14:10
surprised when I looked up this design standard and saw that it said an ambiguous language aluminum or metal
1:14:16
sighing or sheet specifically just using the word shell we specifically addressed
1:14:22
that same issue with the ARB review of 328 it's like I said it's the fishco Creek development Zone but it had the
1:14:28
same language in it and John Clark said the specific intent when we wrote that was to prevent things like corrugated
1:14:34
like very industrial you know product not I think also so we can we can
1:14:40
definitely readed discuss it but these are these are legal codes but I think the application of sheet in there right
1:14:45
so I think metal sheet that that's where I started to go to one without knowing what John Clark's original unfortunately
1:14:52
for the board to aty point will be the building inspector that has to make normally when we interpret laws we apply
1:14:57
the ordinary and regular meaning to the language and we don't get into this what somebody who was collaterally involved
1:15:05
with enacting the law thought was the actual intent that's right so the primary material I think going back to
1:15:11
now's point the primary material of this building is brick um you know we came up with these discussions during the ARB
1:15:16
and we're going to continue to work on that I mean it's small portions of and panels of the of the building so I think we're going to be able to address that
1:15:22
we'll work through it collectively we're we're we're going to get to that piece of what was historically there too I
1:15:28
just want to interject that I went to the beacon Historical Society to look what was originally on that lot and it was a it was a Girdle Factory that just
1:15:36
had the building had nothing to draw upon that would be a cool you know cue
1:15:41
for a future design unfortunately it was really just zero to work with there in
1:15:46
terms of inspiration yeah I one way to I think resolve it without getting into uh
1:15:53
definitions you know textual definitions are legal is to provide a more detailed
1:15:58
submittal maybe a physical submitt of those metal panels and the way that those look because there's many ways to
1:16:04
render these things but as you know like looking at the object right is going to give you a much better idea of what to
1:16:12
expect it's a custom color it's all sorts of other you know there all sorts of specific things that have been worked
1:16:18
through on that yeah yeah and again the way I read it is it doesn't necessarily prohibit all metal and that there are
1:16:24
certain instance where metals are inappropriate metal yep and aluminium um
1:16:30
but turning back to the comments also that Natalie brought up there were some Design Elements and considerations I
1:16:35
think Natalie did a great job of of sort of detailing and those that are in the audience have likely taken the turn down beakman and seen where the existing
1:16:41
buildings are set into the hill the applicant has made taken a significant undertaking by contacting the New York
1:16:47
State DOT and the Federal Highway because back during urban renewal there was effectively a the dot and Federal
1:16:53
Highway had to work together to make that acquis position uh and move forward so that's an extensive discussion that's
1:16:59
been well underway and is there's a group called purg I call Purgatory where the matter Still Remains with Dot and
1:17:04
Federal Highway to sort of finalize it but it's all been positive feedback we anticipate to be able to move forward but what that does is bring our
1:17:10
buildings up to the frontage and help activate that streetcape um our site plan does show it and we've really
1:17:16
worked hard to adjust how Street trees or benches or access meaning access points down by High Street into the
1:17:21
building how the inter relation at the corner with beakman and 9 works so all these things are being integrated to
1:17:27
sort of again create you know I think the chairman said early on we want to make sure that this is an opportunity and one that's well uh addressed in way
1:17:35
in way that really you know sets this building apart um some of the ways that we've done that uh the building on
1:17:40
beakman and High Street has been designed to incorporate Gable roofs and Dormers uh with the design of of nearby
1:17:45
Victorian residences the corner Towers at both proposed buildings are intended to evoke the turrets found in several of the surrounding residences um we had
1:17:52
projecting window bays in the new building so we have a lot of different pieces that we're trying to implement in these building designs that work also
1:17:59
well recognizing the context of this area and its Redevelopment in the last you know however many years um and of
1:18:05
course this project being in a property that was fully um I guess Changed by by urban renewal
1:18:12
the elevation of those residences on High Street also um helps you know sort of uh maintain the visual Integrity of
1:18:18
their current view sheds to reinforce how that would you know uh interrelate with our site but I think uh someone or
1:18:24
all of you mentioned tonight that an additional rendering is being provided because the site section didn't quite get the full picture quite literally so
1:18:31
we are putting together or we do have at least site uh the draft of that but it wasn't ready for for tonight's
1:18:37
presentation so we're providing that just again reemphasize um how all this comes together I think Mr seagull
1:18:42
mentioned tonight how we'll continue to work at least from the rooftop component other ways to continue to to modify that
1:18:48
to get it there um we do have a significant Landscaping plan other implementations there so we are sort of
1:18:54
um you know the your draft NE decoration does a great job of of speaking to how it interrelates with Community character
1:18:59
linking to the waterfront downtown encouraging residential development as as Natalie mentioned there are a host of
1:19:05
you know the the project really was designed to do that and has gone above the Call of Duty when it when it went to
1:19:11
the do to try and bring this this building closer to the frontages so I hope I identified a lot of that but a
1:19:16
lot of this is in our submissions but now it's for us to and we we did provide a a detailed um sort of called Seeker
1:19:22
submission that laid out each of these different factors s but we to the extent I missed any I'll review the video and
1:19:28
and we'll put that in writing so so again a little bit more work to do on the secra um and then you
1:19:35
know anticipating next month's looking at view sheds yes um so with that unless
1:19:42
there's any other discussion around the board on any other topics we discuss we are in public hearing for secra and site
1:19:48
plan so um those of you from the public who would like to share your thoughts uh
1:19:54
and comments with us please do so um just be reminded that we put a five
1:20:00
minute limit on comments and um do your best to try not to repeat if you've
1:20:06
submitted in writing um we have that in writing and on the record you don't
1:20:11
necessarily have to come up and repeat yourselves um but you're welcome too um
1:20:17
and yeah Teresa you're chopping at the bit
1:20:23
the bit good evening thank you I think I saw you hiking today the deterioration of the
1:20:30
city's historic overlay districts view sheds and natural environment is already evident with significant disappearances
1:20:36
happening daily before our eyes last night at the city's workshop we heard the mayor and the administrator say that
1:20:42
revising the comprehensive plan is not that high on their to-do list to the outcry of a majority of the council
1:20:48
members our current comprehensive plan includes plans for improving the streetcap between Main Street Street and
1:20:54
the train station along beakman Street and West Main Street however what we're witnessing at this level is a push for
1:21:01
high density development that leaves no room for fresh air or true Open Spaces
1:21:06
up the hill to Main Street rather just a mass buildout on every corner at the
1:21:12
last planning board meeting you made numerous comments about how you did not want to see a four-story buildout
1:21:17
merging the two Rose Hill Mana properties with a large Hotel and Conference Center on what you called the
1:21:23
gateway into Beacon from the South yet entering the Gateway into the city from Beacon from the north less than 6 miles
1:21:30
in the opposite direction you're still encouraging a monstrosity to emerge from the ground on beakman street and High
1:21:36
Street Main Street and High Street are the historic districts and if not legally binding on paper they should be
1:21:43
our historic charm is what is driving tourism our Landmark preservation oversight barely exist I'm not blaming
1:21:50
you but the city an Architectural Review Board is not the same as an actual historic preservation commission every
1:21:57
surrounding City and municipality in the Mid Hudson region has one please put a nail in this coffin and say no to these
1:22:03
submissions as submitted before they are allowed to put a single shovel in the ground thank
1:22:08
you thank you anyone
1:22:15
else people to give their name and address please yeah your um name and address please hi I'm Donna Rubin I'm on
1:22:21
40 Cliff Street um within about 2 minutes walking distance from the project and I truly apologize if I'm
1:22:28
going to repeat or contradict something you've already said tonight but the Acoustics in this building are really
1:22:34
awful when you sit in the audience you cannot hear anything so I don't know whether it's something that be done with
1:22:39
the Acoustics or people could speak into the mic but we're doing our best I just can't hear anything the chairs are no
1:22:45
better either so well I'm thank you I want to be it's a public hearing so I want to benefit from the we'll we'll do
1:22:51
our best to project thank you okay so as I said I'm I live very close to this
1:22:57
proposed area proposed project and my marks are very brief but I'm continued
1:23:03
to the to the committed growth of the city I'm eager to see new development new energy and new creativity here
1:23:09
especially new residents who want to work here and make this their home however I am strenuously opposed to the
1:23:16
proposed development at 45 Beacon for the following three reasons first of all
1:23:23
scale this pro project is monolithic in scale and completely overwhel overwhelms
1:23:28
the footprint of the property it is simply too much construction for too little space this year bulk and size of
1:23:34
the buildings are visually overwhelming and not in keeping with the substance of the built environment in Beacon we want
1:23:42
development but we want right-sized development this project is wrong-sized
1:23:47
second reason aesthetic the visual design of the Project Beacon is a unique look and feel
1:23:54
to its um Ambiance and feel derived from its years as in 19th and early Century
1:24:01
early 20th century manufacturing Hub that look and feel is worth its weight
1:24:06
in gold most cities in town across America would love to have the character and personality that we have right here
1:24:13
on our streetcape in Beacon it fuels the tourist traffic and it's what draws new
1:24:20
residents and makes this a special place to be and a unique place to be
1:24:25
yes we need to adapt to contemporary uses and styles of living we aren't living in Colonial Williamsburg no one
1:24:32
wants a city preserved in aspe aspic we're living in 2025 but this project is
1:24:38
out of keeping with the unique historic character and the look and feel of the town we want new buildings that blend in
1:24:45
harmonically with the old to create a cohesive visual look especially for a
1:24:51
property in such a prominent position that a that's a historic
1:24:56
district um I don't know if you just referred to this I just couldn't hear but the newly added Gables Gable roofs
1:25:02
and dormers on the upper floors of the building do not mitigate the over monolithic the over overall monolithic
1:25:10
design I I feel it's just bad design for a very special City and the third reason
1:25:16
I heard something about parking but I couldn't tell what you were saying parking the project calls for 64
1:25:22
residential dwellings uh it's roughly like 31 bedroom and 32 bedroom units with 91 off street parking
1:25:30
spaces if that's correct the average American household has two cars and a quarter of All American households have
1:25:37
professional visitors coming and going and entertain guests several times a week so my question is where will all
1:25:43
those cars go finally My ultimate message and remarks that Beacon is a
1:25:49
town filled with character if you approve projects with this scale and
1:25:54
design we will lose what's special about the town it's the wrong choice for our
1:25:59
city we deserve so much better I urge the planning board to send the proposal
1:26:04
back to the drawing board thank you for your time thank
1:26:15
you chill hey hi everybody uh Jill Reynolds Willow
1:26:22
Street um let's see quick comments uh I agree with the last speaker one about
1:26:28
the the Acoustics in here are terrible can't hear a thing back there so I don't know what you guys have been talking
1:26:33
about um but I did hear something Jill there's still a seat left I I I'm sorry
1:26:40
I have to go real soon but uh I did hear something about
1:26:48
um the sight lines the view from whether you could see it from the top of the hill and according to to and I was
1:26:54
wondering about that too so the according to my deep dive into the duess
1:27:02
county partiel access map terrain version the building is cited at 100 ft
1:27:11
even and the top of the hill is 140 um if the building is four or five
1:27:19
stories that's going to be 40 or 50 ft so that'll put it at 140 or 150 and the houses of up there will be say two
1:27:26
stories so that's another 20 ft so they're at 160 so they will be looking down on the roof that's my and I would
1:27:33
also like to Echo the previous speaker's comment about scale of the building um
1:27:41
it I I spent time looking at the West End
1:27:47
um exhibit at the Beacon Historical Society a couple months ago and it was
1:27:54
really moving because it was obviously such a community that got wiped out
1:27:59
there and I grew up in Chicago on the south side of Chicago and I saw it
1:28:05
happen there too and I was only 10 and it affected I mean it didn't affect my
1:28:10
neighborhood but I could see what was going on so that that Community was made up of
1:28:18
many buildings and this is the scale of this that that I find
1:28:24
irksome is um it's just one building on that whole lot and it just feels
1:28:31
wrong sorry I can't be more technical thank you Jill thank
1:28:46
you remember to hi Dave Nelly 24 High Street
1:28:55
my building is from 1870 and the borders of my building uh
1:29:02
there's a small triangular piece of property off the back of it I uh I have
1:29:08
a problem with the surveying uh I had it surveyed when I
1:29:13
bought it and the uh pressure treated Stakes are still
1:29:20
in the ground now I come to find that obviously to their benefit there's
1:29:28
a stake 15 ft into my property this really needs to be corrected but on the other
1:29:36
hand the people on High Street purchase their house to be a
1:29:43
house and there's property around them now this property serves a privacy uh
1:29:56
uh agenda the other thing is these houses are
1:30:03
investments so if we're going to put a a
1:30:08
large structure as this um I'm going to lose my
1:30:14
privacy I'm going to have people knowing what color toilet paper I use and that's
1:30:21
a joke that's the best joke I could come up with they're going to know what I'm eating what TV I'm
1:30:29
watching when I'm in my backyard and that's that's not what I bought the property for I bought it
1:30:36
because there's a a good amount of property around it and there's a privacy
1:30:43
matter the second thing is uh they are homes but they're also
1:30:49
Investments and if I understand this High Street may be one of the only
1:30:54
streets in Beacon if not the only street that has all Victorian
1:31:00
houses now if you're going to put this large building
1:31:06
uh there's there's somebody who's a brilliant person named Sir Isaac
1:31:13
Newton and one of his postulates was for
1:31:18
every action there's an equal and opposite reaction for every gain in property
1:31:27
value for this new project there's going to be a decrease in the property value
1:31:34
of every house on High Street now I don't mind if uh the city
1:31:40
of Beacon wants to cut my assessment in half cut my taxes in half and compensate
1:31:48
me let's say to the tune of $250 million $250,000 uh that's that I would ENT
1:31:55
entertain that but other than that let's just say you all I don't know how many
1:32:01
of you have houses but uh let me come to your house and put and take 15 ft off
1:32:09
the back of your property I could pave that and start parking cars
1:32:15
there let me start peing in your back windows and tell you what you're
1:32:22
doing I don't think that would go very well and let me
1:32:27
ruin your investment on your property I don't see anybody smiling
1:32:34
about that either so the three things that are a problem is the preferential
1:32:42
surveying that was done the loss of privacy for the people
1:32:48
on High Street and the loss of investment value
1:32:55
not just a home but investment value and now we're talking money so I thank you
1:33:01
for listening and I would like each and every one of you to imagine that you
1:33:07
owned a house on High Street think of losing property think of
1:33:13
losing privacy think of losing investment value thank you thank you if you have
1:33:20
any questions thank you
1:33:30
next hello hi it's Mary alen case I live at nin High Street thank you David that was
1:33:38
sort of reflective of I think what a lot of us feel um this I wasn't necessarily going
1:33:45
to start with but anyway since we're talking about the houses on High Street we just did a um poster I don't know if
1:33:51
you want to show also that a little circle so um you know we did really make
1:33:58
a very big investment at least I did by the time I got here and buying these houses and we've put a lot into them I
1:34:05
think I mentioned that last time but you know this is along Tomkins and along
1:34:10
High Street you know pretty much all the houses this one is interestingly enough
1:34:16
the one that Norm scoffield built that this is where my office is this is on Tom on 90 and Tomkins
1:34:24
and it's interesting in the sense that it really fits in with all these other old houses so I mean as soon as I saw it
1:34:30
going up I needed an office I thought oh this is cool this is like a a a minute walk but it it just makes a point
1:34:38
because it really does look very similar so you know in consideration of that and
1:34:45
everything that David just said you know we thought that we would just sort of show this and you're welcome to keep it
1:34:50
too if you want um we also consulted with someone who had
1:34:56
been a surveyor I can't say that I'm technical at all or even understand a lot of the details of this but some of
1:35:02
the points that came across that I just want to bring up um for some reason they
1:35:07
felt this person felt that the horizontal scale of these drawings were not equivalent to the vertical scale so
1:35:15
they wanted they suggested that we confirm that so that was one um this may
1:35:21
have changed I noticed that possibly the high the one on high streets maybe a little bit lower now the building but if
1:35:27
the building height was allowed to be 48 ft why is it actually 58 ft with the rooftop mechanical equipment there is a
1:35:34
big concern about you know seeing the mechanical equipment the other point
1:35:39
that was brought up is that
1:35:52
r1-- houses so it was essentially I didn't even get this when they were telling me this but it just has to move
1:35:58
you know they were suggesting move it back closer to 90 I guess so that it's
1:36:05
set back at the same level and then just general questions I don't know if these have been brought up because it it is
1:36:10
really hard to hear I'm getting to think I was losing my hearing but um how many units and have been built and bacon in
1:36:17
the past 5 years what is the occupancy rate of these new structures will there be affordable housing in these units I
1:36:24
don't think I don't remember that being brought up um and then the sunlight the shade
1:36:29
how does the shade from the four-story height requirement affect the adjoining owners and then I think that maybe this
1:36:35
is being addressed but a lot of people have been bringing up the sore system and I think that I mentioned it last
1:36:40
time so how much additional space will be needed in the seore system to accommodate this new development there's
1:36:46
a lot of concern about that and then lastly whether this is accurate or not I'm not sure but evidently there were
1:36:54
some surveyors circling around you know we see them all the time and supposedly there's going to be a road now that is
1:37:00
going to cut you know like say you're coming down 9 90 and it's going to go
1:37:05
down to two-way go from High Street to yeah and that's
1:37:13
what right Dave what the surve that's what the surveyor told him so you know
1:37:18
how's this all going to really work and that's about all I have to say today
1:37:23
thank you but thank
1:37:30
you anyone
1:37:37
else hi I'm Rob 16 High Street I border 177 ft of this property um I was going
1:37:44
to do another PowerPoint presentation but I kind of backed off but now I'm thinking maybe I should have so you'll
1:37:49
be getting something in the mail so like the other gentleman um I woke up the other day last week go make a cup of
1:37:57
coffee and have a surveyor on my property he was on my property for about 3 hours he surveyed my whole entire
1:38:03
property so um I'm wondering if the all the surveying that's being done on these
1:38:10
properties in high 16 High Street are they going to share um these uh surveys
1:38:17
with these Property Owners just to make sure that like for instance I submitted the last time I was here my uh site plan
1:38:24
so I'd like to see because I asked a surveyor do everything look the same and he said he had questions on what the 45
1:38:32
beakman what they thought and he wasn't lining up because they now do things uh
1:38:38
I guess some satellite and U he said I was okay but and that's all he said and he would have
1:38:44
to go back to his office so I would like to have that actually looked at all these extra serving that they're doing
1:38:50
on these properties such as the gentleman in the back had 15 ft taken from them thank God I don't have Stakes on my
1:38:56
property um the other thing is the drainage distance from the retaining wall 4T that's absolutely nothing uh
1:39:04
like I said the wall is 100 the wall is 136 years old cuz my house is is 136
1:39:10
years old no mortar used and to be digging a trench 4T from this wall and
1:39:16
if you actually you to go down there you'll see sections of this wall that are compromised and going in with a back
1:39:22
ho and digging out could possibly really cause some damage because as I said last
1:39:27
time on that topographical map a lot of water's been draining down for many many you know hundreds of years and you start
1:39:34
digging this soil out who knows what's going to happen you have a shift 4 ft is
1:39:39
definitely Too Close um another thing that keeps coming up is our houses we
1:39:45
set up on High Street we're looking at the back of this thing and I think you brought this up last time I haven't seen
1:39:51
one uh architectural design design what the back looks like all of High Street
1:39:56
is going to be looking at the back of this and who knows what that's going to look like am I going to see uh like
1:40:03
garbage uh things that are going to be sticking there what's just the back of the buildings look like another thing is
1:40:10
the picture they brought up of my house that they used for that uh retaining
1:40:15
wall it's totally out of scale I'm 18 ft from the property if you come to my
1:40:21
house you're you're invited I will look on the roof of this this building and
1:40:27
I'm going to get noise pollution and they're going to be putting up a little fence what else you going to do in order
1:40:32
to uh to quell this noise pollution and and um you know service units going off
1:40:38
air conditioning cuz High Street sits as that other topical map I had showed you
1:40:44
we sit above this thing we're not at street level we're a top so we're going to be getting all this noise pollution
1:40:50
as well so that has to be looked at a little which honestly I was happy that you were questioning that right just
1:40:56
having a green little fence around it to protect it but what about the noise okay and um another thing is there
1:41:06
are a number of very mature trees that run up along High Street there's actually 11 them very mature trees which
1:41:13
will help block especially marel and a couple people's homes from looking at this
1:41:19
monstrosity are these trees going to be cut down there's a lot of very short trees I actually went around there's 11
1:41:26
trees down High Street there's 127 trees going up beakman there's 13 trees at the
1:41:34
other end where uh spy studio is and there's 33 trees that help maintain the
1:41:42
retaining wall in the back going up uh the properties not mine cuz my trees are
1:41:48
on my property but run up along the uh back of these other houses which support
1:41:54
that retaining wall so another thing is so so how many trees are being cut down
1:41:59
and also I would like to know when they do this back fill and I imagine I'm
1:42:04
putting a little retaining wall a distance from the retaining wall the original retaining wall how high is that
1:42:11
going to be now this they're not going to I assume not back fill and actually
1:42:17
cover this retaining wall I imagine hopefully they're going to go up about 3 or 4 feet and back fill into the base of
1:42:24
the retaining wall thank you thank you
1:42:31
you
1:42:38
next hi my name is James Ellinger I'm on West Church um I did submit but there's a few things that were discussed tonight
1:42:45
that I just wanted to add um so I won't read through sure I won't read through my whole thing but I'll I'll just add
1:42:51
what I um what I'm hearing about tonight uh specifically uh the um I strongly
1:42:57
oppose the development um again the scale I appreciate it's been noted a few times that um the comprehensive plan
1:43:04
states that new construction should be compatible with its surroundings as related to footprint size setting roof
1:43:10
line building envelope size scale and mass um the applicant raised this in
1:43:16
their rebuttal by mentioning West End Lofts and the view as comparators uh
1:43:21
those two buildings were built after the comp comprehensive plan was written so um they really bypass the intent of that
1:43:28
document by referencing those buildings that creates a cycle of incrementalism um on the aesthetic side
1:43:35
uh the metal siding issue is definitely one to look at I read I didn't read sheet metal I read metal siding is not
1:43:42
to be used shall not be permitted uh by saying that this building is primarily
1:43:48
brick and has some metal sighting seems to be disingenuous the building is
1:43:53
looked at from a side view looks primarily metal glass and brick on the
1:43:59
corners and some in the central um then the from the environmental footprint
1:44:05
side uh that uh Street transition zone issue that was brought up um I've
1:44:12
watched all of these proceedings that was discussed but it was never definitively determined whether there
1:44:18
were Utilities in those areas and that could not be done it was simply suggest suggested that that's possibly what it
1:44:25
was and that it was dropped since then um also lastly on
1:44:30
Transportation um it was noted here that they were going to change the uh traffic
1:44:35
lights that actually has happened uh on going down from West Church down or up
1:44:42
from beakman those lights are longer than they have been that's very recent within the last couple weeks um which
1:44:49
has somehow made the problem worse because now the people coming up from the train are being stopped for a longer
1:44:56
period of time that the length of cars coming up are getting longer and longer
1:45:02
and cars are bypassing on 9d without interruption and it's talking with
1:45:07
people last time I was here they said the problem is actually people going too fast down uh beakman to the train it's
1:45:15
not a backup there the backups coming the other direction which I live above and can see every day that's where the
1:45:22
problem you know has occurred and again it's gotten worse because that light is now
1:45:27
longer um again I I really urge the Ping board to vote no on this project have them go back to the drawing board start
1:45:34
over thank you thank
1:45:41
you anyone else
1:45:54
um so thank you for the public comments I know we're certainly going to provide some additional responses to in writing I think a lot of some of the comments we
1:46:00
heard tonight we did here at the last meeting which we worked to address in our supplemental submission um you know
1:46:05
I know we have our traffic report there's been a few comments to that extent this evening um but a lot of the materials or or comments about size and
1:46:12
scale I mean we've we we've identified how we've um addressed those throughout the submission and materials but we'll
1:46:18
we'll certainly address these as we would uh in any submission uh in a suppl written response to you thank
1:46:26
you anything else not for this evening Mr chairman thank you good are you here
1:46:32
for the next one too uh just to continue the hearing uh yeah we're going to continue the public hearing yeah that's
1:46:37
it continue to April keep it open yep great that goes without saying doesn't
1:46:43
it what's that if we don't close it that goes without saying no just the have say for the rest continuing the public
1:46:49
hearing until they we will hold the public hearing open through to next month great thank you thank you all
1:46:56
right that brings us to item number two on our agenda which is public hearing and
1:47:02
continue review of application for site plan approval mixed use commercial and residential 291 Main Street submitted by
1:47:09
telephone be building Beacon LLC and so the first order of business
1:47:15
here is for us board to open the public hearing I will accept a motion to do so
1:47:23
motion motion by David seconded second by Len all in favor I I
1:47:34
I Chop Chop good evening again good
1:47:46
evening okay um so this is the telephone building at 291 Main Street there's
1:47:53
commercial on the ground floor of this proposed Edition and then um three apartments on the upper
1:48:00
floors we submitted updated plans um based on the comments that we received
1:48:05
last month um and we updated the design based on our discussions at the last
1:48:12
meeting so we let me just get to
1:48:18
that he are you this this one up here looks different from what we have in the
1:48:23
package yeah I I I received the you know the photo realistic renderings recently
1:48:31
but it it it reflects that design that I showed it's just this one has the better
1:48:36
images on it is this in the package or am I missing something this one um the the
1:48:43
drawing is but those images are not the the photo realistic the elevation in the package matches what the current design
1:48:50
is but the renderings do not right the yeah the the the renderings are updated to reflect what was submitted as
1:49:00
revised see yeah this yeah I understand oh and then
1:49:07
this thing down here I see okay yep okay oriented yeah we we submitted the
1:49:13
revised design but we got those um renderings more
1:49:18
recently see so so what what we talked about last time we um sorry we
1:49:25
simplified that corner column detail on the Main Street elevation we added um
1:49:31
that stone detail to the base of that thinner column near the commercial door
1:49:37
and we extended that upper Corners around so it wraps around the building to where it you know uh becomes the
1:49:44
three-story building you know further back than the existing telephone
1:49:49
building and then at at the back um you know what we were talking about I was able to lower that first floor in
1:49:57
the back by about 5 feet so that that brought that whole um proportion you
1:50:03
know down and much lower just it's going to transition at the stairs so they
1:50:09
don't need to line up across um you know so we are keeping the height at Main Street because that carries those some
1:50:17
of those lines across so you're saying the rear building became lower by how
1:50:23
almost 5T yeah we we were just keeping it high originally so we you know had that
1:50:31
correspondence with Main Street but it it didn't need to follow exactly like that MH can you discuss materials it's
1:50:38
hard to tell what materials we're talking about and I don't see any call outs I'm just trying to piece together
1:50:44
the these to see what oh yeah so so um previously with that higher rear
1:50:50
elevation we we were showing that with siding cuz we were talking about you know relating more to the Residential
1:50:56
Properties along the street um we we had some uh communication from shipo who
1:51:04
wanted to see a little bit more integration with the Main Street facade so we we changed that to Brick so so
1:51:12
it's the same material all the way through um we we kept the gable roof
1:51:18
to you know sort of continue that relationship with the resident properties on the street and and it also
1:51:25
just sort of you know dampens the you know if it we looked at a flat
1:51:32
roof but it was just sort of fighting with the telephone building so so this this kind of reduces the volume of it
1:51:38
visually um and and then we also used a standing seam metal roof to you know to
1:51:46
work with the brick and not just be like a residential asphalt roof so it so you know and so basically
1:51:55
we we addressed a lot of the things that we talked about um at the meeting last week in terms of the building design so
1:52:03
I'm I'm now just registering that yeah the rear building changed from what looked to be woodsiding with
1:52:08
brick columns right now to you're saying this entire rear building is Brick yeah
1:52:17
and that was that was in response to comment by shippo yeah they were asking
1:52:22
asking I mean they didn't specify how to do it but they were suggesting to try to
1:52:27
keep it more unified with the Main Street facade and you know so so you
1:52:33
know so so we kept the material coming how around like
1:52:39
that letter is attached if you yeah I'm just wondering how how binding shippo's
1:52:45
recommendations are think it should be so binding on us yeah I mean it's not it's not you it's
1:52:53
recommendations good because I'm not sure I'm in line with the recommendation but
1:53:00
we'll discuss it okay anything else you wanted to add no I mean that that's the
1:53:06
main uh you know change to the to the building design that that we reviewed last time yeah I got to say
1:53:13
just real quickly now the gestures you've made at the again I keep losing it oh at the
1:53:22
main Street facade are an improvement it just resolves that sort
1:53:29
of odd corner with the plint on top that was just kind of floating
1:53:37
there can I ask a question John yeah that for you for all of us on the board is does that does that window on the
1:53:46
second floor of the Main Street facade of the addition is that compliant with our
1:53:53
you know Main Street design recommendations of having windows that are taller than they are wide because it's only the Mullens that really you
1:54:00
know to me it presents as a as a really large Square window yeah which is not you know
1:54:07
compliant with the the window proportions yeah I agree that that window itself now that now that it's
1:54:13
been sort of jammed up the top has been jammed up against that new cornice piece
1:54:19
it just feels odd I'm wondering if if there's a way to
1:54:24
perhaps you know within the same language meaning you've got you've got that widest part where the windows are
1:54:32
inset M if there's a way to just bring that inset sort of with a
1:54:38
surround at the top window right bring that in and and just make that window
1:54:44
smaller in proportion so that you have an ability to have what feels more appropriate in terms of sort of air on
1:54:52
the top like a like a true lentil and it just helps with the proportion yeah is that worth studying
1:55:03
yeah we could also beef up the the vertical M to to get some space between that but also can it be two windows yeah
1:55:10
but I would I would yeah maybe maybe even look at it as two separate windows with a brick pillar between yeah I was
1:55:15
looking at Brick and and I mean if we're not going to do it like this with the
1:55:21
you know with the same Mion that I mean I think we could also do that with a thicker um framed mle you
1:55:29
know vertical wood whatever whatever you would need to do to make those
1:55:34
proportions um yeah narrower and higher yeah more narrow
1:55:41
than they are high right yeah and then I think just as having
1:55:47
those Dimensions noted on elevations is helpful to just confirm that too yeah
1:55:52
and I and I got to say I'm sure the planner and our engineer are going to mention this too but for the life of me
1:55:57
I cannot figure out how you're going to fit these cars in in the parking cuz it it just looks like especially that one
1:56:03
closest to the street it's it's so hard to tell whether especially from the renderings I understand the plan is
1:56:10
probably more accurate but whether that parking spot is inboard or outboard of
1:56:15
that uh Bree fet um cuz on your plant it looks like it's
1:56:22
outboard yeah but on the rendering at least the old one with the wood or even this one yeah the this
1:56:30
update I think it's just like the the the view but um Mike can talk about that
1:56:36
a little bit Yeah so then so then we'll look to the plan as more accurate right
1:56:42
just spacewise it does not look like a car is going to fit but we'll we'll talk about that M so is
1:56:50
there anything else just in terms of updates in your presentation before we go to our engineer and planner I don't know um
1:56:58
Mike you want to talk about the the parking yeah okay we we we'll let uh
1:57:05
John do that yeah so start with you now then yep I'm trying and speak into the mic um
1:57:12
so many of my comments are the same as last month because I think the responses were details will be provided so again
1:57:19
mechanical equipment um on the roof for this building I think the response letter said will be provided uh the
1:57:26
Landscaping plan um the response letter had a note saying the Landscaping plan had been
1:57:33
added to the set and submitted but Revis sheet 7 was not received in in the packet I received so
1:57:40
I just wasn't clear on whether we did get that or that was another thing that was intended to be
1:57:47
forthcoming um who submit I see seat 1 2 3 and four
1:57:52
here your cover sheet says Landscaping plan is sheet seven of eight I did not 5 to eight okay H so he's got sheet five
1:58:00
to8 here is seven seven seven is in there but it wasn't in my hard copy set
1:58:09
either it's here oh so now it are you looking on in my what I was reviewing
1:58:15
was not um so might have been just a confusion about submission times and and
1:58:22
what got and what set y um for parking standards I think we've
1:58:29
been talking a lot about the parking and the and the layout um we're still proposing kind of four parking spaces to
1:58:35
serve both the existing office building as well as the proposed new structure I think there was conversation in the
1:58:42
response letter um stating that the existing telephone building provides parking spaces for two of the existing
1:58:47
commercial tenants and their leases uh in their leases so my question was just
1:58:53
I think we've talked a lot about shared parking or um for this site so I wasn't clear on what the intent is for those
1:58:59
four spaces are they are they going to be for the are they dedicated to the commercial tenants through the leases um
1:59:06
or is it going to be a shared parking situation for the residential tenants as well just to kind of understand how the
1:59:11
site's going to operate and who's going to be parking there um elevations again I I kind of
1:59:17
reserved my comments on the dimensions as they are required for the historic District as well as the CMS District
1:59:23
just because we have um elevations but without any material call outs or or
1:59:30
dimensions on them um and then I I was pointing to the shipo letter I think the other and I
1:59:36
guess I I was missing this in your rendering it looks like shipo had two comments right one was about the cornice line on the on the Main Street Building
1:59:45
I was seeing it now and one of the elevations that that was and now it's in that that new
1:59:50
rendering right right so you're I believe that's the corner sign they were talking about about continuing that all the way around and kind of bringing down
1:59:57
that stacked thing on the edge so I think we B's already kind of talked about that
2:00:04
um and then I missed the material change in response to their comment so that's something I'll have to just look closer
2:00:10
at and respond to because I'm just seeing that now um so those are my those are my comments
2:00:18
for now thank you yeah Mr Russo um so as the project progresses the
2:00:24
project engineer will need to prepare a construction cost estimate for work within the road RightWay um with regards
2:00:31
to the parking um we have a number of questions with regards to that the stall that is outside not underneath the
2:00:40
proposed expansion that's right against the building you can't even open up the
2:00:47
doors it squeezed between the trees that are supposed to be there and the building bu I don't see that as a
2:00:54
functional stall um and then the other concern is the ability of the vehicles to move out
2:01:02
from underneath given the number of columns especially the one in the last stall backing out is it possible to back
2:01:08
out and maneuver or how many movements will it need to make I mean you might be able to help
2:01:15
yourself if you can get rid of some of the columns there you are you talking about
2:01:21
the westmost one where they'd have to back up and then basically turn into
2:01:27
their lot line in order to yeah backing right I mean I don't know how many
2:01:34
maneuvers you would have to make backing out of that um yeah so you've got that one and
2:01:39
then you've got the one to the Far East yeah that is against the structure righty up against that um and then given
2:01:46
the number of columns in between you know I I think you they
2:01:53
could have their structural engineer look at reducing that and I think that would
2:01:59
help yeah I think it's worth looking at the columns um we're also looking at
2:02:05
possibly moving the loading zone for the handicap space to that stall which would
2:02:11
eliminate any maneuvering out of that stall issues to which stall the um westmost to the eastmost to the
2:02:19
westmost ah yeah uh um that would solve that problem and just I I did take a
2:02:25
look at the car moving out of there it you know typically when you back out of a space you swing back and you go
2:02:31
forward and you're out this car would have to go forward and then back one more time to get out according to the
2:02:38
software that I have someone with a smaller car might be able to get out of there but a normalized vehicle might
2:02:45
have to do a two-point turn to get out of that space or you basically back out of the
2:02:51
whole thing all the way to the street my cad guy asked me that and I
2:02:56
said I don't think that's going to fly but um one of the other comments I had
2:03:02
is the landscape area on the east side that they were saying was snow storage
2:03:08
uh we now have trees there yeah um so we basically have no place left for snow
2:03:13
storage so I think additional notes are going to be uh need to be added to the
2:03:19
plans with regards to getting the snow off for this site and how
2:03:24
quickly thank you you're welcome
2:03:30
board question for AR about the the interior uh Heights of the floors in the
2:03:37
the commercial space facing Main Street and the uh residential space above it what are the ceiling Heights
2:03:44
roughly the ceiling height of the commercial both the the the
2:03:50
commercial ends up being like 14 15 ft and and so basically the idea was to
2:03:56
align the second floor at Main Street with the second floor on existing telephone building so we can get those
2:04:03
window alignments um because there's a couple steps up to the telephone building which we don't have on the
2:04:10
addition you those commercial ceilings are um High I'm just um the reason I'm asking
2:04:17
is is um I think from a from a do no arm perspective to the telephone building
2:04:24
the existing building I would prefer if that cornice
2:04:29
didn't have to butt right up against the bottom of the existing historic cornice I mean if there was more you know vertical space in
2:04:38
between the two I feel like it would be kind of less of a of an insult to the to
2:04:45
the existing structure and that that would mean
2:04:50
lowering the height of the of the addition entirely and you it would impact what
2:04:57
you're saying is having the the windows line up across the second floor but it's just so
2:05:06
crowded anything else board yeah um I think one of the solutions and I've said
2:05:13
this and I'm I don't see uh any way that this has been
2:05:19
solved um or that much effort has been made to solve it but uh the way to
2:05:25
resolve the main problems with this is to have that Main Street Frontage be one
2:05:31
story and I until that's done I don't know how you can not
2:05:38
visually harm the way that this uh building exists in the on Main
2:05:44
Street um also the whole site plan I mean there's multiple problems with the way this this site's being developed all
2:05:52
of them are self uh imposed they're not things that are required for you to have
2:05:59
these are these are there's there's a lot of problems with the way this whole project has been
2:06:05
designed and presented and um I uh I'm
2:06:11
very skeptical about it unless some major changes are
2:06:16
made uh I'm I'm concerned with how much uh is being being built onto the Brett
2:06:24
Street part of the um of the site it feels like there's a little bit too much
2:06:29
stuffing for the taco
2:06:36
there the phrase of the evening I love you got the visual image
2:06:43
perfect making me hungry
2:06:49
oay yeah yeah I mean look I can understand you know this idea of the building in the
2:06:57
back wanting to sort of depart from the main building separate itself both
2:07:02
physically and aesthetically because it starts to make its way into the
2:07:08
residential sort of language but again just be just based on its
2:07:15
scale it's trying to mimic a house but it's not and it's nowhere near the scale it's much larger than the house just
2:07:22
adjacent to it that sort of single low slung arts and crafts right next
2:07:27
door um and and and you know this whole idea
2:07:32
of the stilts and the brolay is just it's just awkward right um but if you
2:07:39
know the intent is to continue down the road of that architectural
2:07:46
language we'll just address this shipo recommendation I think it should not
2:07:52
mimic and it should be a different material and in this case the lighter
2:07:58
more appropriate to the architectural aesthetic being the wood um so
2:08:06
that's that's my comment there um yeah I I tend to agree with Len the the you
2:08:12
know the idea of um trying to just Nuance this
2:08:19
buildings at the main street at elevation relationship to the old building if you could take a just a
2:08:26
deeper I know we keep sending you back but if you could take a deeper look at that because again I think what you've
2:08:32
done with the cornice on the new building is trending better though it
2:08:37
then also creates that issue with the top window that we just discussed so I would look at that
2:08:43
simultaneously okay and then what what about that idea of lowering the whole thing and then not you know sort of get
2:08:51
getting away from that bringing the lines across from the existing
2:08:56
building yeah I mean I don't know whether you can do
2:09:01
both yeah I'm I'll look at it look at it yeah so um anything else board Mr Jensen
2:09:10
do you have anything no I mean my the commment I I said from the outset was this building
2:09:17
already doesn't have enough parking and you're increasing demand and taking away working so yeah and we did talk about a
2:09:24
um sort of an analysis right I think we heard from our planner a couple times about coming back with um some precedent
2:09:33
yeah the the applicant was you know try trying to explain how how it worked and
2:09:39
and what what the takeaway that I got from it was
2:09:44
that he he has deals in the lease you know for a couple of the commercial
2:09:49
tenants who who are there during the day on certain days so we we'd be looking at
2:09:54
it as a shared you know parking situation where two of the spaces are
2:10:00
generally you know used during the day but I think what we're asking is
2:10:06
there any comparables to see actual need
2:10:12
yeah right yeah that's what I was referring to so what you're referencing is a sort of a simult a non-simultaneous
2:10:19
use yeah so dual dual use parking spaces right right so they're residential
2:10:25
during the evening but during the day they're commercial yeah I mean we we've you know used that scenario for a lot of
2:10:32
projects so but how's that work on weekend you read my mind it also doesn't work if you take the train to work right
2:10:38
I mean a lot of people are working from home these days still yeah I think we need a little bit
2:10:44
more convincing this is going to work okay um do have one of those the comment
2:10:52
um as we're looking at this the Landscaping on the West Side between the buildings
2:10:58
underneath how is that proposed to survive I mean it's directly under a
2:11:03
building yeah I I I know that um Mike was looking at the species that are
2:11:09
being proposed there and and they're um you know shade tolerant they're they're meant to live under there okay what
2:11:16
about watering I mean I guess they're going to have to be watered or what do we
2:11:23
yeah I would love to know what that plan is that doesn't doesn't need sun can
2:11:31
live its entire life in shade and will rely on a human to feed
2:11:37
it moss moss here you go do you remember the old um before the town CER was
2:11:46
renovated they had put little planners underneath this big overhang on the street
2:11:52
that none of these plants ever got any sun no attention they were just filled with cigarette butts it was the worst
2:11:59
and that was one of the niest things you did was get rid of those planners because if if they don't work
2:12:06
they uh oh this important component because if if if things can't live there it doesn't really classify as landscaped
2:12:13
area yeah okay all right we'll go to the
2:12:19
public anyone here who would like to share their
2:12:28
comments name and address please and as best you can right into the microne bre Street sorry 7even South Bread Street
2:12:35
Patricia I'm the neighbor yeah I'm sorry what's your name Patricia shusa shusa
2:12:41
and and it's 7even CBR Street my address so I don't even know where to start I'm
2:12:47
so shocked by what's happening here um
2:12:53
I knew the previous owner Deborah who renovated this
2:12:58
building put her I was basically she did this fantastic job and I hope she
2:13:04
doesn't know what's going on that's my secret hope that she does not know but
2:13:11
um beside that um I moved from Brooklyn about
2:13:17
years eight years ago to avoid co- up with the wall view from my living room and my
2:13:24
kitchen and this is exactly what I'm going to get the two windows well three
2:13:32
windows on that side are my living room I slightly see the sky because I can see
2:13:39
it on one side of the telephone building and of course the street with this new
2:13:44
construction i w see any light no sky
2:13:50
and of course you know the Privacy forget about that because looking at the
2:13:57
plan people will go the windows on my side will be living room windows and the
2:14:03
kitchen windows exactly what I have on my side
2:14:09
um there are other issues which affect my property and one of them is um the
2:14:19
car wash which I get IC roof on the car wash during storms the water goes
2:14:26
straight to my property and I'm getting so much water that every time my
2:14:32
basement is flooded with this new roof I'm going to get additional amount of
2:14:39
water and of course now it's going to be asphalt that water is not going to go anywhere so I don't know how they will
2:14:46
solve that problem uh that's definitely a big problem
2:14:52
um with additional roof um now the parking on on our street
2:14:59
is impossible I have constantly people parking
2:15:05
on in front of my gate where sometimes even when my car is parked inside people
2:15:13
just feel like you know let's park and I have to call the police to come and remove the car it happened once many
2:15:20
times I will just go to um I'm a restaurant and ask who is the person who
2:15:26
parked in front of my building my driveway and of course you know I've
2:15:31
most of the time I can find people but they have basically basically said where do you
2:15:38
want me to park my car there is no room now I specifically looked today day day
2:15:46
before yesterday how many cars are parked in a parking
2:15:52
uh of the building telephone building is between 3 and 4 so it's not two it's usually three or
2:16:00
four if you're going to have three additional Apartments four plus I don't know how
2:16:06
you're going to fit these cars um the corn our street is very
2:16:11
popular because there is of course two restaurants there is that little daily
2:16:17
when people love coming for the coffee and and their uh sandwich and in the morning and lunch so it's very busy dur
2:16:25
in the morning midday and of course with the restaurant in the evening so it's
2:16:32
constantly basically if you have a guest I don't know where they going to park the
2:16:38
car it's getting more and more crowded so uh the parking is going to be huge
2:16:45
issue not only for the for the tenants of the new new renters or whoever
2:16:51
they're going to be and the commercial tenants have no idea when they're going
2:16:58
to be parking their car and I definitely don't want them parking in front of my
2:17:03
driveway um also uh my property line is not where
2:17:08
the beautiful chain link fence is uh it is at least 18 in inches towards the
2:17:18
their property so I don't know if the plan indicates that or not I don't have
2:17:23
a survey but I know that for a fact um so that may so I think they were
2:17:29
planning of on having some bushes or some vegetation along the fence I don't
2:17:35
think that's going to happen then um during the day right now because people
2:17:41
are Park I guess may maybe up to 4:00 or 5 p.m. and then they go home but sometimes
2:17:49
especially younger kids come at night with the headlights straight into my living room I can't imagine what's going
2:17:56
to happen when these cars are going to be trying to get under the
2:18:01
stilts of the house to park the cars I will have constant light uh day and
2:18:08
night now night um from that I mean there was so many problems with this I
2:18:15
can't imagine this being built and it's they're trying to pack this in this when
2:18:21
you really walk by that look at the parking it's a small area and you need this much room to try to park the car
2:18:30
under I can't imagine this this makes no sense to me do you uh you have any other
2:18:36
key points here I'm sorry you're getting close to time but I want to give you a chance to wrap up no thank you basically
2:18:43
thanks very much um I don't want to see it and if it is going to happen it will
2:18:48
happen will have to happen with really big changes and of course I don't want to garbage on my side of the of the
2:18:54
fence I don't want to smell garbage from three apartments and and the commercial property I don't think nobody mentioned
2:19:00
about that and water definitely thank you thank Youk you anyone
2:19:12
else Teresa craft this developer plan will destroy
2:19:17
the symmetry of one of the most beautiful and iconic build buildings in Beacon the planning board does not have
2:19:23
to allow this kind of ravaging of a significant and historically designated building and its footprint I believe
2:19:31
shipo is overburdened and losing its directive which is clearly evident when they say the work sounds generally
2:19:38
appropriate in their brief letter dated February 24th that response is so
2:19:44
wishy-washy in legal ease what does it mean to use the term generally generally
2:19:50
means usually or broadly if something is Right generally then it's right most of
2:19:56
the time though perhaps not in every case thank God it's Taco Tuesday please
2:20:02
do not approve the submission thank you thank you
2:20:09
next hello hi my name is Marilyn the Jesus I live in a n South bre Street
2:20:16
we've been there for 40 years and it's getting more like she
2:20:21
said she's my neighbor congested it's awful you can't find parking there at
2:20:27
all I don't think this plan is going to help at all he's talking about backing up sometimes I can even back up out of
2:20:34
my mother's driveway cuz that is so the street is small now if you're going to
2:20:40
build something the street is going to get smaller and like I said there's too much traffic going on in there at all
2:20:48
it's a beautiful building why we want to miss something that's history and Beacon
2:20:53
just like everything else everywhere you turn around there's a building where's the history of Beacon people want to
2:21:00
move from the city over here because it's beautiful it has beautiful trees
2:21:05
but it's getting messed up everybody wants to build something in an empty lot
2:21:10
they need to respect the people my parents came here with nothing they own
2:21:16
a house there they love the street they love the building my father sat there in
2:21:21
that front of the building for many years he passed away of cancer but that was his spot and I see a lot of people
2:21:28
standing there why you want to mess up that history building we do not want it
2:21:34
there at all thank you anyone
2:21:44
else my name is Irish kintana I'm owner of 10 South breett Street and Trustee of
2:21:49
12d win Street um I've lived here for over 50 years and
2:21:54
I own that house uh at 10 South breath for the last 27 I chose to live here because uh I
2:22:01
love the community and I grew up here so I know what the old Beacon looks like I've gone with the changes and you know
2:22:08
some of them have been really really nice I have to say but um our our street is getting crowded I have a son and a
2:22:16
husband and um I have to often my son has to pick Park elsewhere he can't even
2:22:22
Park in his house so I do pay somebody else for a parking for my son isn't that
2:22:27
ridiculous that I have to do that but um during the day I work from home as well
2:22:33
and you know there's a lot of traffic there during the weekend again a lot of
2:22:38
traffic um you know uh with this building being there is just going to
2:22:43
take up our spots that we I can't invite anybody over for what you have to park at my mom's you know my my mom's is like
2:22:51
three or four blocks up so let's park there and walk down you know and that's what we have happened to do that if I
2:22:58
want to have an event in my house um I would just consider for the panning
2:23:04
board not to um approve this in such a little spot if people want to you know
2:23:09
do these type of things they should look for a spot primarily when they first look for a spot to see that it does fit
2:23:16
um and leave this one I I knew the previous owner to the building and she did Immaculate work herself uh bringing
2:23:23
this building to um what it is today it's a beautiful building don't mess it up having other things built in it thank
2:23:30
you thank you anyone
2:23:43
else hi can you hear me yes thank you uh my name is Katie HTH W one I'm the
2:23:49
former tenant of the building under the former owner Deborah Bigalow who restored the telephone building herself
2:23:54
over the years my office was in the front occupying the two front windows and for a period of time in the basement
2:24:00
where there was three offices I experienced the lighting inside of each of these spaces as well as in my
2:24:06
neighbor's space in the back office on the first floor which was very impacted by light coming in through the back
2:24:12
windows I was ATT tenant under um also under the current owner shotty TW when
2:24:18
he took over the building during the time time of his ownership the telephone building as well as nine other buildings
2:24:23
on Main Street were designated historic by Mayor Lee kaku's administration at
2:24:29
the time most building owners objected to the designation including this owner of the telephone building in maxan the
2:24:35
historic designation can make remodeling efforts difficult and costly at the time the city council was creating ways it
2:24:42
seemed to preserve the traditional look of Beacon on Main Street as well as create mechanisms to control what was
2:24:48
proposed to be built but first test of this was to Maxis on Main which became
2:24:53
Lion Share but that new owner was attracted to the historic designation he told me and I reported he completely
2:25:00
renovated the outside of the building on the first floor for the restaurant um he liked the historic feel he didn't mind
2:25:06
it was historic the telephone building that former owner Deborah restored was her treasure she was delighted that the
2:25:13
building was being considered to be designated historic she sold the building after she completed her final
2:25:19
restoration work which was color matching and repainting the cornice as well as applying the gold leaf to each
2:25:25
of the letters of the telephone building at the top in the cornice she would bring color samples back and ask me my
2:25:31
opinion even though I could not tell a big difference between the shades of cream she could she was mindful of all
2:25:37
of her neighbors she would not put the spotlight on the back of the building to illuminate the parking lot if it shown
2:25:43
too brightly into her residential neighbor's house for the driveway she kept it gravel so that it could absorb
2:25:49
as much water as possible if changes if that changes the water collection will be different I am surprised that this
2:25:57
second test of what seems to be a historic building is happening with the owner I anticipated a debate between
2:26:03
neighboring buildings like with the Howland Cultural Center years ago when the building next to them wanted to
2:26:08
build seven Apartments onto the rear of that building but doing so would have blocked the light shining into the
2:26:13
Howland Cultural Center the light was part of the architectural design of that building that debate resulted in the
2:26:19
building not pursuing the apartment buildout the owners later tried selling the building after they could not build
2:26:25
the apartments the realators at the time told prospective new buyers that they could build these additional Apartments
2:26:31
even though we all watch this get shut down telling prospective clients that they could build apartment seemed
2:26:37
irresponsible the proposed front building of this is out of character uh from the telephone building I do not
2:26:44
understand why anyone would approve of of this design that is touching a historically designated building I I
2:26:50
asked them why the building was designated historic at all a few of the characteristics of this second building
2:26:56
would follow those Styles the combination of the hous likee design in the back that looks like a beach house
2:27:02
reminds me of a development called neighborhood launch in Columbus Ohio that uses four or so architectural
2:27:07
Styles modern like this tow housy like telephone building Colonial and like the beach house and another style the
2:27:14
difference is the projects those styles are spread out across many blocks of Columbus not squished into one tiny
2:27:21
parking lot speaking of the parking if cars are to go under the beach house this will be a tight turn I've parked in
2:27:27
there and it will be tight I also submitted pictures to you all and it's in that packet the board asked for the
2:27:33
pictures of how the snow would be plowed I took them and they submitted them for your review um it's currently being
2:27:39
pushed into the neighboring Car Wash building and along the Back Fence of the house behind the property the beach
2:27:44
house will block the back of the telephone building despite the height being lowered 5 ft here in the revised
2:27:49
plan hands the house will block the windows on the back of the building which obstructs the light going into the
2:27:55
back office which is crucial to the Ambiance of that office the two basement offices also rely on light just looking
2:28:01
out at something that is not a building or wheels of cars I agree with all of the comments the board members have made
2:28:08
at this point at the past two meetings of this project these two proposed buildings are out of place there is no
2:28:14
quote red reducing the volume of it with twoot reduction or 5 foot reduction here
2:28:19
and there and shaving of a corn is there the buildings themselves are the volume to quote the board member lend two
2:28:25
meetings ago a design would need to quote complement the building not degrade it if the two buildings are to
2:28:31
be there if at all thank you thank
2:28:36
you anyone
2:28:43
else okay I think we'll keep the public hearing open I think we have to until
2:28:50
next month is there anything else the applicant wanted to add um no I'm just wondering I I I
2:28:56
assume this is going to make its way to the ARB subcommittee um no we're we're basically
2:29:03
doing our Architectural Review in real time okay all right perfect yep you got
2:29:09
the whole board for this all right that's even better now I'm I'm all set you all set
2:29:14
yeah thank you thank you okay we'll go to does anyone need a break yes yes we're going to take take a quick
2:29:21
two-minute break while Aria picks up his Mouse we'll be back
2:29:29
shortly we are going to resume our regular meeting uh with item three on the agenda
2:29:36
we're cooking with gas this is public hearing and review of application for amended site plan approval addition to
2:29:43
existing funeral home to beakman Street submitted by crossix LLC uh first order business here will be
2:29:50

2:30:11
funeral home building um which was you know and that that site plan was originally approved in
2:30:17
2017 there were no comments from the Consultants or the board last time so um
2:30:25
we made minor updates on the on the drawing that was submitted and that's
2:30:30
all I have uh okay um we'll go to the Consultants I'm assuming rather quickly
2:30:37
uh I had no comments I had no comments wow that's a first

2:31:03
just wanted on the record that place needs to have this approved 214 Square F
2:31:08
feet is it I mean just don't interrogate this project
2:31:14
too much let it go thank you that's rich coming for you too
2:31:21
wow a long one thank you appreciate it and anyone else I have one procedural
2:31:27

2:31:59
bit do you have something you just wasted 30 more seconds
2:32:05
um is there any discussion or deliberation around the resolution uh if
2:32:11

up to now continue review of applications for site plan approval and subdivision approval mixed use
2:32:43
commercial and residential 420 430 fish Avenue submitted by DK realy LLC good
2:32:49
evening good evening again I'll keep this very brief uh my name is tor Palmer with the law firm of cud and fader on behalf of the applicant I'm joined by
2:32:55
Chris Elli our project architect as well as Dan ker from Hudson Land Design and Rich DeAndre of uh cers I'm also joined
2:33:02
by the applicants the Hees um as you mentioned Mr chairman we're before you for the continued review of our site
2:33:07
plan application for a site plan Amendment uh well as a lot merger application uh for the Mixed use so the
2:33:13
board is aware you held your public hearing back in February at which time the public hearing was closed we have had a chance to review your dra approval
2:33:20
resolution uh we did not have any further comments we did uh include some supplemental materials in our February
2:33:26
25th submitt that included responses to comments and then we updated uh some yep
2:33:33
some Minor Details uh including designations of meats in bounds on the proposed easement area uh that provides
2:33:38
access to the proposed walking path between Fishkill Avenue and the rail trail and the Fishkill Creek Greenway Heritage and connection Trail and then
2:33:45
we added a mountable curb for deliveries only uh at the entrance driveway of the Southern portion of the property um we
2:33:52
did include some details about dimming the lights based on the hours of operation and identified quantities of
2:33:58
evergreen trees and shrubs and grasses planted on the property and we did incorporate additional drainage grading
2:34:03
and elevation notes uh so with that that's really our update presentation for tonight thank you um so we'll go to
2:34:10
our Consultants um I know Natalie you had one comment
2:34:15
about a note on the site plan yeah uh most of my previous comments
2:34:20
um have been addressed uh through revisions I think the one that was
2:34:26
remaining is discussion of what exactly the the shape of the crossing should be
2:34:31
and what that that um device should be the signal should be for safety of pedestrians and the note was saying kind
2:34:38
of subject to final recommendations of the fish kill Avenue Concepts committee um so while that committee is looking at
2:34:45
this cor or they're going to be a body making recommendations to the council and the administration
2:34:50
uh so if that does make it as a condition of approval um for that to be later decided which maybe makes sense in
2:34:57
terms of timing of this Corridor I don't believe that's the correct body I don't know if it should be staff or councel or
2:35:04
something but I don't think it should necessarily be the committee that that's written to um noted and then I think you know we had
2:35:12
talked a little bit about what that should be and I think um Ken worstead is not here tonight but previously had
2:35:18
recommended that that should be p pedestrian activated right so that the the light is only blinking when The
2:35:23
Pedestrian is pushing it because if it's blinking all the time like you get with the yellow light that's in front of Mill Street people just eventually stop
2:35:30
paying attention to it and you kind of ignore it so I'd recommend that that kind of be worked into the requirement
2:35:36
or discussed within the condition or mentioned as well that being y did you want to address yeah I think we'll just
2:35:42
have Mr DeAndre speak to the conversation with Kayon because I think ultimately we proposing certain signage not necessarily the flashing blinkers we
2:35:48
were saying that that may may not be consistent with what's in the corridor for example by the dog park um that's more in line with what had been
2:35:54
recommended and I think ultimately the city's consultant agreed that that would probably be the better utilization here
2:35:59
this isn't an active Crossing presently where these would typically be proposed this wasn't proposed by our consultant
2:36:05
it was just sort of offered as an alternative but I'll let the traffic expert just speak to that briefly I'm I'm lost what what is It ultimately you
2:36:12
are expecting to install here at the crosswalk okay thank you so really we we had initially
2:36:19
proposed just warning signs so pedestrian warning signs at the at the
2:36:25
Crossing location with arrows that point down uh pedestrian sign yield for
2:36:31
pedestrians in the middle of the crosswalk and then advanced warning signs that alert you ahead of the crossing that there would be uh that
2:36:38
there's ped pedestrian Crossing there in addition to fresh new striping yeah there because there is no crosswalk
2:36:44
there today yes um then we had considered maybe doing the consistently
2:36:50
blinking signs but I think there was some push back on that and blinking there um reality is that the the next
2:36:58
level the RFB the rectangular rapid flashing Beacon that we talked about that are push button activated those
2:37:04
really are meant to be installed in locations where there's a clear need um
2:37:10
and guidance doesn't really doesn't want you to put it in locations that it's not really
2:37:16
identified that there's a need there's an accident history there's a signal significant number of pedestrians because over time the more places that
2:37:22
we install these things the more they don't get obeyed is really the idea um
2:37:28
by by drivers um so I mean I think if the in the future if this does become the The
2:37:34
Crossing location that people are going to go down to the trail or something like that then maybe there is a need at that this location but in the immediate
2:37:41
future I don't I don't know that that's the case the other thing to kind of consider here is you're actually at a
2:37:47
intersection location so technically based on just do or mutcd guidance we
2:37:53
don't actually need any um pedestrian signage at all but we are
2:38:00
recommending that we put in the standard signage because it is a new new Crossing location so nothing consistently
2:38:07
flashing I think we all agree that that's not appropriate you're recommending that it be static not Flash
2:38:14
not pedestrian activated just standard like Signs yeah
2:38:20
and I think we yeah I think we had talked about that and Ken had mentioned that too I'm not saying that the flashing beacons or that is is warranted
2:38:27
now but again that's why I was thinking it would be more of condition because right we are there's a proposal for a
2:38:33
connection right you're proposing some kind of connection easement to a rail trail should that ever occur right and
2:38:39
you're acknowledging that there may be more pedestrian activity on this side of the future by the banked sidewalk space
2:38:45
and potential future recommendations so at some point in the future this may be a more significant Crossing so I guess
2:38:51
that was I don't know if that's possible but that was kind of the recommendation if to to condition right
2:38:58
so based on a call with the traffic engineer with Ken wer from kraton Manning earlier today um his
2:39:03
recommendation was to use signage at this time that was consistent with the signage that exists further down the
2:39:10
street I think it was at the at the dog park further down Fishkill Aven um that that would be the best signage to
2:39:16
include now and because it's it's we don't know if or when I
2:39:24
mean hopefully there are recommendations and there's an implementation of a streetscape um you know uh plan for the
2:39:31
Fishkill Avenue at sometime in the near future we don't know if that's going to be a year from now 5 years from now 10 years from now um so the thought was
2:39:39
because that is unknown at this time um let's have the applicant install the
2:39:46
signage that's appropriate today yeah that makes sense flat no one stops for those signs or striping I live on 90 I
2:39:53
cross it every day with my dog no one ever stops for pedestrian at signs and just striping the lights they have the
2:39:59
the lighted Crossing up by Sergeant school which is obviously try to you got to try to use those crosswalks like
2:40:04
you're trying to drive in New York City just boom just go out there yeah I mean they're not stopping on their own no but
2:40:11
but that's like you know that's kind of taking your life in your hands I don't I don't think we can solve The World's
2:40:16
problems here no but I'm just saying if this is going to be like with the rail trail a a coffee house I would say you
2:40:23
know I don't I also I'm kind of a little confused because there was was there ever an offer to do it with consistently flashing lights if then why not
2:40:30
pedestrian activated what's the the the issue with The Pedestrian activated versus the consistent consistently
2:40:36
flashing is the posts that they got put on and the the amount of equipment that goes with The Pedestrian activated right
2:40:43
the cost and and and the requirements that you need to install those versus the consistently flashing is
2:40:48
significantly more and then the other concern that we had was that if there are recommendations from the committee that say we're going
2:40:55
to put a sidewalk in on the sight side of the street in the future now if we
2:41:01
install the the beacon now is it in the wrong location in the future and does that have to now be moved these are on
2:41:07
concrete bases they're on I I I understand that and I but I'll say one last thing about having serviced my car
2:41:13
at what used to be Freedom Ford a million times and walked back from dropping it off getting a acoss Fishkill
2:41:20
Avenue is about 10 times worse than getting across route 9d it's like running across a two-lane Highway
2:41:27
compared to running across a Boulevard you know so it's just lived here 30 years you know plenty
2:41:35
of personal experience it's not easy to get across those roads as a pedestrian you know fishal Avenue just it's not
2:41:42
friendly to pedestrians you know period I share this sment about people not stopping I to be honest I think under
2:41:48
the CC circumstances what was being proposed is probably the best balance of it's it's more than nothing which is
2:41:55
there now right so did you have something the only I was going to say is I think maybe as the committee's
2:42:01
recommendations get put into implementation maybe maybe it does become more pression friendly traffic slows down along that Corridor as things
2:42:07
get redeveloped that maybe it you know things change but I understand where you're coming from right now the way
2:42:13
that Corridor is today so
2:42:20
so where did we land we're going to we're going to move ahead with the
2:42:25
understanding that the static signage installation along with the striping Etc as you as you described
2:42:32
it is what you're going to install yeah MH okay all right um where were we it's
2:42:41
getting late can we reserve in the future that if it if a pedestrian activated uh signal is necessary that
2:42:48
they can install it in the future I me what's the future though I
2:42:53
mean it whens the future and how does this title necessary well if you're
2:42:58
still there operating the you know if if the Dunkin Donut site is still
2:43:04
operating hypothetically speaking in 7 years and the trail is operating and you
2:43:10
have 20 people crossing the street you know every hour maybe then we need a
2:43:16
pedestrian activated signal and maybe then Dunkin Donuts or whomever the owner
2:43:22
of the lot could install so that their customers could be
2:43:27
safe crossing the street to get to Dunkin Donuts you know and I'd like to I'd like to add something to what Karen said which is that the old Dunkin Donuts
2:43:33
which was on the opposite side of the street was much more accessible because the sidewalk is on that side and that's
2:43:39
quite literally what the fishal Avenue committee is working towards so you had you know there were there was a lot of foot traffic to that location but they
2:43:47
didn't have to cross the road at that point today there is no Fishkill Greenway Trail in that Corridor there's
2:43:52
just tra the itself is going to cause enough pedestrian understood and that committee is also working towards things
2:43:59
like stairwells and access points and other things that they themselves will be implementing throughout the quarter
2:44:04
so those kind of considerations will be will come through the process and again
2:44:09
we're we're proposing what the both traffic Consultants have recommended for that for the corridor so I I appreciate
2:44:15
what you're you're suggesting and we are still working to implement certain sidewalk ments or other you know measures there to try and reflect when
2:44:22
that committee gets to that St so when are you going to make the walking path for the future rail trail when is that
2:44:28
happening we're putting that in the site plan that's part of the the Improvement has to happen so can we have an
2:44:34
improvement of a pedestrian activated signal in the site plan when that trail access is built again we don't know that
2:44:41
there that will be utilized for those purposes that's it is a green space it is it has benches it's utilized for more
2:44:47
than just a connection it's offered as a potential future connection because of the potential not because it will happen
2:44:54
so we've Incorporated that into the site planine so it will be built out but it is also acting as a green space on the
2:45:00
site so it's not just a connection point it's also a green space that has other
2:45:05
utilization on the plan so that's why that's being built out I understand that I understand that clearly I'm I'm asking
2:45:13
why can't in addition to that potential future Trail build also include a
2:45:20
potential future pedestrian activated Crossing signal typically that would
2:45:25
require something like a bond that could be un we don't know the term of that Bond we don't know the extent of when
2:45:32
something like that would ever or if ever it would be improved so there would need to be some type of limitation on
2:45:37
the extent of how long that is because essentially it's just putting money in a pot that may never be utilized so that's
2:45:44
the purpose of why we're installing what's necessary at that location which is the static signage which is consistent with the corridor so that's
2:45:50
why we're proposing and why why our consultants and and your consultant agreed that that's what should be implemented here the comments are not
2:45:56
not taken or they're just this is what's proposed because that's what's the traffic Consultants are ring as the safe
2:46:02
effective mechanism and because this is the condition today not what could be and while we all hope that will be the
2:46:09
case for the rail trail it may never be um so it's really the bonding and the
2:46:14
and the non The Unknown about when that could ever be installed so we're planning for it by adding that location
2:46:20
but it may never come to be so it may serve only a purpose as a green
2:46:28
space okay um Mr
2:46:36
Russo um so we are waiting for some descriptions for the revised easement
2:46:41
for the storm water pipe and they did submit a construction cost estimate we
2:46:46
had some revisions that need to be done to that cost estimate that's what we have at this
2:46:52
point okay um is there any other discussion we do
2:46:58
have draft resolution um from Jen's office is there any other discussion
2:47:04
around that as we consider adopting that resolution
2:47:10
board is the draft secret is that what you're talking about this is a resolution to adopt type two there's no
2:47:17
secra okay um type two action so you have a draft resolution of approval plan
2:47:22
and subdivision meeting um well I have a concern that I want to bring up which is the circulation in the parking lot that
2:47:29
I don't feel is accurate is uh clearly uh described the way that um traffic is
2:47:37
coming into this site and the way that arrows are indicated the traffic arrows are indicating how they uh work it's not
2:47:44
clear how um on the left hand side how a
2:47:50
uh a vehicle would uh there's there's
2:47:55
opposing arrows where the dumpster is and where the proposed um uh pedestrian
2:48:02
crosswalk go across right that you can't uh if if if there's no
2:48:09
parking in that area you'd have to turn around and it's wouldn't be possible to
2:48:14
make a U-turn you'd have to back up you see what I'm talking about no other side yeah in that route right if
2:48:22
you go in straight from that entry let's say you don't realize that you have to make a sharp turn and it's not clear
2:48:28
because you don't have a turn arrow indicated there for the uh
2:48:33
drive-thru right if you go straight and all those parking spots are filled up
2:48:38
right you can't continue on because it's a one-way driveway and you'd have to
2:48:43
turn around it's not clear that that works especially if you had like a trailer or anything like that
2:48:49
the other thing I don't know is whether or not um uh vehicles um have has there I maybe I
2:48:58
missed something but was there a uh um did you do diagrams with the U
2:49:06
larger Vehicles yeah there I don't know if they're in the yeah latest submission
2:49:11
but there was with a fire uh with a sorry with a garbage truck a single unit
2:49:19
30ft box truck and a wb40 tractor trailer truck all all
2:49:26
utilizing the truck only entrance that we have identified on the South Side
2:49:32
using the loading zone and circulating around the building okay and that's that's the reason why because it doesn't
2:49:37
work in the rest of the site right that's why that loading to zone is there for oversized Vehicles that's it's just
2:49:43
the general loading zone yeah because it is a little it's a little awkward you know that they have to cross a uh what
2:49:50
would be a busy uh traffic Zone yeah provide deliveries we responded I think
2:49:56
directly to the planner's comments about that we had originally proposed residential parking there and that was changed to be a loading zone to minimize
2:50:03
its utilization and ultimately limit it to what's required in the code which is a loading area so that was changed
2:50:08
explicitly in response to comments with the board I think you went loading residential parking then back to loading
2:50:14
yes yes yes that's true fair enough so P for compl
2:50:19
history I just don't want yeah if You' got big vehicles park
2:50:27
there and you're driving a small car like you know I think it's a valid issue
2:50:34
of that one lane for how how do you get out of that lane if it's all full and you're driving
2:50:42
in yeah I mean it's not a a completely uncommon situation I mean the the only
2:50:48
thing that I could say that if that's a major concern of the board that we could do is make the dry vial that's nearest
2:50:57
building one way and the other one the one way so that's all oneway circulation but that means basically every vehicle
2:51:03
that comes into here has to go around through the that back area yeah although
2:51:08
if you think about it if the parking lot's like half empty people are just going to cut through empty parking spots
2:51:14
and it'll be like good enough so maybe that's a better idea but that's not the
2:51:19
condition that's a problem it's a problem when the parking's all filled well right no no but if they so in other words if they so that it's not going
2:51:25
both ways and the lead up to that one way right mhm and also do you have
2:51:32
signage indicating where you go for the drive-thru we have sign for the
2:51:40
drive for the drive indicating drive through this way right
2:51:51
and if nothing else I think the site plan needs to show that turn right as one of the options because right now it
2:51:57
really seems like you're going in and out of that one Bay parking Bay and uh
2:52:04
like I said it's a problem if it's filled and we're certainly these are things we can certainly address they're
2:52:10
not I don't think these changed really the overall functioning of the site plan or couldn't be handled as a condition to
2:52:16
an approval I mean these are all things that are no one's objecting if there's an additional request for a sign we're just
2:52:22
bringing up concerns yeah yeah I think I think the the mention that Kevin makes
2:52:29
is valid um and if the solution is um one way he's talk not
2:52:36
here we can certainly review that with Ken to the extent you know that what recommendation if the board would be
2:52:42
comfortable with that what Ken would recommend there based on your comments yeah
2:52:56
what John was just saying that if on the most the northernmost uh dry B the one that
2:53:01
you're having the issue with right if someone comes down if there was just a no inter sign there somebody coming into
2:53:09
that driveway would be able I mean you'd have to do this well with signage would be able to enter the just this first
2:53:16
like this would be the loop right they wouldn't have to do the full they would have to do the full drivethru
2:53:21
loop they would just do this smaller Loop are you are you indicating this they would just do this right it's not
2:53:27
like every car would have to go that whole yeah that seems like seems like you can make it all one way I mean
2:53:35
yeah yeah it seems like a very elegant solution um to put a positive spin on
2:53:41
things I'm sorry I don't think we have a problem with that yeah and then the signage for the drive-thru yep yeah
2:53:49
where are you going to put it it seems like it'd be wise to address it before we you know
2:53:57
proceed what are you suggesting Kevin that they come back next
2:54:03
month we condition this which I think is preferable yeah I think these are
2:54:09
conditions that you would typically see in your engineers memos and planners memos as site plan amendments right and
2:54:15
signage is typically also handled through sign permit applications so yep
2:54:20
so um do you have enough to create conditions to our draft I do I
2:54:27
have three changes to the resolution one to reference um that the note on the
2:54:32
plans reference in Natalie's memo uh should reflect that the applicant shall install the static pedestrian warning
2:54:39
signage that's consistent with the signage that currently exists at the dog park on fish K Avenue to the west of the
2:54:45
property y um second that the site plan shall be revised to convert the northern
2:54:52
Drive aisle to a one-way condition um
2:54:57
and I haven't quite figured out uh traveling towards Fishkill Avenue and I
2:55:02
can find a better way to describe that exiting the site or E yeah I don't know exiting the site yeah um and then also
2:55:11
that the site plan should be revised to include uh Drive the drive-through
2:55:16
signage yeah directing um motorists coming into the the lot
2:55:22
where to go for the the drivethru I would say you may want to move the do not ENT signs up all right so you have
2:55:29
them on the Eastern portion of that Northern Drive
2:55:34
aisle you'd want you'd want to right you'd want to move them up yeah they would we would have to do some
2:55:40
modifications with the one way do not enter signage for the oneway circulation yes okay because even the drive aisle
2:55:46
nearest the building would have to be oneway right heading towards the back of the site both would be one way yes both
2:55:52
would have to be one way yep okay so you'll use crafty lawyerly language for
2:55:58
that yes yes I'll put my crafty hat on okay I trust you uh and then the third
2:56:06
did we cover the third one yeah the signage to direct motorists entering the
2:56:11
site to the drive-thru okay um so with that this is
2:56:17
so much fun um I will accept a motion to adopt this resolution with the three
2:56:23
amendments as described um um are you getting ready to
2:56:29
make a motion motion motion by Karen second second by David all in favor I I
2:56:36
I nay thank you who's nay Kevin
2:56:41
okay what for what reason Kevin I would suggest you state I'd prefer to have a
2:56:47
more complete uh presentation of the uh concerns about site
2:56:52
circulation okay noted thank you very much thank you uh next item on the
2:57:01
agenda um where were we oh boy okay review of applications for amended
2:57:06
special use permit and amended site plan hotel and restaurant 1113 Walcott Avenue
2:57:12
submitted by prophecy prophecy theater LLC
2:57:35
good evening so we um submitted the updated
2:57:41
site plan and uh additional drawings that were part of the original set to reflect the reduced building design that
2:57:47
we presented at the last meeting um you just to remind you again the hotel is
2:57:53
going to have 16 rooms instead of 30 uh we are working on the landscape plan
2:57:59
just to catch up with um the the new site layout so that that'll be submitted
2:58:05
for the next um month
2:58:10
um and then we're we're also working on the revised design of the smaller Hotel
2:58:16
it's going to be a similar idea just uh smaller scale and we we'll we'll get
2:58:22
that into you okay um Consultants want to start with
2:58:27
you John that's fine uh so the traffic management plan
2:58:35
uh should be updated to reflect only 36 off street parking spaces I think it still States 39 from what was previously
2:58:43
submitted um exhibit number two in the traffic plan and exhibit number three they should be clear so we can read them
2:58:51
I mean you're calling out um parking areas on it and everything else they're not legible
2:58:58
so um based upon the notes provided on sheet one of 16 with regards to uh noise
2:59:08
mitigation it appears that what was previously proved is being reduced I
2:59:14
brought this up at last month's meeting um yeah we're going to put that
2:59:19
back and those notes will show up on that plan that's what we were told last month too yeah it was
2:59:26
uh we had a uh technical error okay
2:59:34
um oh and then I'm still recommending uh post monitoring of traffic and parking
2:59:41
management very good nalie um y limited comment
2:59:49
um again so complete site plan set I think is my comment and I'll have to
2:59:54
check sometimes I guess what what I get sent and then what eventually maybe gets added to the website later but I was
3:00:00
still missing four and seven yeah sheets for so it's just not a complete set so I
3:00:05
just didn't know if I was missing information on those sheets it says 1 through 16 um or sheet number of 16 right but I
3:00:13
didn't see 4 7 or 16 no 16 was there was
3:00:18
that supposed to be the wzt tc-1 yeah okay okay it did I didn't see
3:00:25
where it said that was number 16 but I could assume that um again just kind of notes on sheet one
3:00:32
of 16 with the same thing that um John mentioned about the parking is that you still have the old parking um number
3:00:38
there noting 36 um noting 39 so that should say 36 and I think this kind of
3:00:44
goes along with the proposed noise mitigation um is the proposed like hours of
3:00:51
operation so I just saw some conflicting information I think um hours of
3:00:57
operation listed in note three on sheet one of 16 did not match hours of
3:01:03
operation indicated in the eaf so I just um I think one was saying kind of 8 to
3:01:09
11 another one was saying 7 to9 or 7 to 10:30 so we're just trying to figure out
3:01:14
I think we're just trying to get a clear like what's the proposed hours of operation what's the proposed noise mitigation that's going forward and then
3:01:20
I think once that's clear we can better discuss um and then I noted the forthcoming
3:01:27
uh updated parking assessment yeah we we we'll give you
3:01:33
those um you talk me about the parking observation um yeah parking observations
3:01:38
and then I think the updated um analysis right we're both forthcoming well the update analysis I
3:01:44
was talking about was post monitoring after everything thing was in uh but as
3:01:50
far as an updated analysis for Seeker I think we'd like to see a table or chart
3:01:55
comparison of what was previously proved to now for
3:02:01
parking requirements you mean well for everything all thresholds
3:02:10
yeah um so that was just mostly making sure we have the cor the correct information for what's being proposed
3:02:17
and just you know those are limited because I understand that the previously reviewed project went through uh
3:02:22
significant changes so just kind of focusing on changes yep okay thank you and then we we also discussed the the I
3:02:29
think it would be prudent to have a comparison of negde previous approved
3:02:36
to uh currently sought right just sort of make sure that
3:02:42
that's on record um and then um would that be part of the the comparison that Natalie was
3:02:49
mentioning oh was did I just repeat what you said well John I mean I started I think John finished it and then you just
3:02:55
added to it yeah I'm just reinforcing he reinforced it so yeah exactly or I
3:03:00
wasn't listening you reinforced it yeah uh okay
3:03:06
so then also any other before we have um some business we can take care of tonight as far as noticing public
3:03:13
hearing but before we get to that any other questions or comments or discussion around the board for the
3:03:23
applicant when are we going to get to see the elevations on the the change to the hotel building oh we we'll we'll
3:03:31
submit that for the next one yeah thanks I'm just curious and maybe we can
3:03:37
do this the next time you come back but i' I'd love to dig a little deeper into
3:03:43
this you recognize this or are you too far away it's what you're calling the um
3:03:49
this thing yeah come on up and maybe this gu oh okay
3:03:59
yeah yeah I don't know if we want to do that tonight but just be prepared for next
3:04:06
meeting um anything else board we have the option of uh noticing
3:04:14
um public hearing for next month might as well yep great motion by Kevin I'm
3:04:21
sorry Len second second by David all in favor I I I anything else for you okay
3:04:29
thank you thank you see you next month uh gosh what was it called
3:04:36
um work Zone traffic control plan yeah I'm just I'm curious about the
3:04:42
signage and the striping and then especially these little black dots what the heck is that
3:04:48
hi good evening we are now at our last agenda item on our regular agenda before
3:04:55
we go to Architectural Review uh that is number six this is a new item review of application for subdivision approval
3:05:01
residential 74 Anderson Street submitted by S Gupta hi good evening I'm Dan kler with
3:05:09
Hudson Land Design we are the engineer for the applicant subdivision is of 74 Anderson
3:05:16
Street as you mentioned uh it's a r in the R1
3:05:24
d10 uh zoning district and we are proposing two lots there each of 14,000
3:05:30
square ft plus uh proposal calls for raising the existing house and
3:05:35
construction of two new homes uh two individual driveways new Water and Sewer Service
3:05:43
connections and um here we go sorry about that trying to
3:05:49
get this map up and trying to keep this thing moving for you
3:05:58
okay here's our layout off of Anderson
3:06:07
Street the existing Home is pretty much where the home is shown on the proposed home is shown on lot one so we're going
3:06:13
to basically be raising that and reconstructing new
3:06:22
that's it that's it crisp um simple this does not require any form of variance it looks
3:06:30
like um zoning compliant it is zoning I like the way you put that zoning compliant um okay so let's go to Miss
3:06:41
Quinn um per code I think the plan I mean technical technicality plan subdivision
3:06:48
it's just in our code that it has to really specifically be called preliminary plat so just changing the title of that document um preservation
3:06:57
of natural features is also section within subdivision so no tree shall be removed from its natural position except
3:07:02
where necessary and incidental so I think just on the existing um conditions and demo just let us know if there are
3:07:09
trees over what is it the six six six in six in sure is absolutely and then if
3:07:15
they're going to be removed or retained just so we can kind of review that section sure uh this came up on the last
3:07:21
subdivision one the the requirement for the front of new dwellings um shall face
3:07:26
the front lot line so I just couldn't tell with the footprint layout where
3:07:32
where the front was going to be so just indicating that um no
3:07:38
problem because the garage is come in from the side yeah side loing garages is the concept so house is still facing
3:07:46
front would be facing show a front door call out the front door and maybe maybe we'll show a little walkway or something
3:07:51
up there too just to bring them around and that was it for my comments besides
3:07:57
that it looked like it met all code requirements thank you Mr Russo um so on
3:08:02
sheet 3 F7 the plat um since the retaining wall is proposed I would take
3:08:08
that off the plat Dan sure um with regards to sheet four of seven you know
3:08:14
we'd like to see a profile for the sore absolutely that's problem um are these
3:08:22
proposed to have a basement or a crawl space we're thinking no you're thinking no I'm hoping no give the amount of rock
3:08:28
you're sitting on a lot of rock yeah there's Rock for sure the existing house is on a crawl a crawl space he's on a
3:08:34
crawl space um yeah so I'm just trying to figure out what's going to happen because I'd like to have notes added to
3:08:40
the plan if not going to be a basement not going to be crawl spaces let let us know I think that's reasonable I'll
3:08:45
speak with the client about that and make sure but I I'm quite sure we'll be going for some sort of slab type of slab
3:08:51
onr okay um let's
3:08:57
see as far as the grading around the homes that needs to be finished out you know state code requires that you drop 6
3:09:04
in in the first 10 ft I'm not seeing any proposed grading between the buildings and how this is all going to work around
3:09:11
and you've got grading for the driveways but nothing around the homes itself
3:09:17
uh front door which we already noted uh the plan should note the size and material of the existing water man
3:09:23
running along Anderson Street that you're proposing to connect to um we need some additional information on the
3:09:30
soore with regards to erosion sediment control plan um there's some revisions
3:09:35
required there as far as location of silt fencing or adding some additional silt
3:09:41
fencing and with regards to the construction details you know we'd like to know how that sort lateral would be
3:09:48
connected into the existing sanitary man we're using a core and core boot likely
3:09:53
we we'll take care of it awesome thank you board anything for
3:09:59
the
3:10:04
applicant um this is an uncoordinated secret review right it is yeah I don't
3:10:10
think there's any other uh Dan we were talking about this earlier um John and Natalie and I I don't think there's any
3:10:16
other involved agencies I mean you need to get health department but that's just for the not necessarily permission to
3:10:23
file so when because we have a easement going through the other lot for the sewer we may need their approval okay do
3:10:30
we want to declare intent so in that D county has that in their RS I believe so
3:10:35
I'd have to confirm that yeah because yeah so because of that just to be safe
3:10:41
all right so coordinate accept the motion to umate designate planning Bo
3:10:47
agency motion by David seconded second by Len all in
3:10:52
favor I and we have the option of sorry was that for uncoordinated review though or that was for a coordin coord that
3:10:59

Mountain Lane new sigle family house good evening um do you need me to pull up on
3:17:02
my computer or UMES not necessarily um we have it here
3:17:10
okay um just for for the record your name um I'm Beth Sigler I'm
3:17:15
the architect um Beth Sigler Studio architecture the applicant and the owner
3:17:21
is Paula Dow okay great you got that oh please repeat that for Mercedes
3:17:29
I'm the architect Beth Sigler hello and um um the owner is
3:17:37
Paula yeah
3:17:45
great don't all jump in at once board any thoughts questions yeah materials helpful thank
3:17:52
you it's this is the Hardy blood shingle the
3:17:57
stco LI wash on the concrete um two um options for siding um tariff
3:18:07
may be uh taken into account so um for affordability so we're looking at either
3:18:14
um a Hemlock or a cedar um with an natural finish so it's what's what's the
3:18:20
difference between these two narrow or wide um no they're different species W
3:18:25
they look very similar this is the cedar this is the headlock um kind of depending on cost so
3:18:32
we're hoping to have a little bit of you know it will be one or the other
3:18:37
um most likely the hemlock for because of the cost but just not
3:18:43
knowing um what's going to happen yep yeah I never know how to codify these
3:18:49
things either or um is either or approv um acceptable it is to me they're pretty
3:18:56
much pretty much similar I I have a question do you know how what the elevation difference between the street
3:19:03
and the house side is um I mean or how far apart are the I
3:19:13
thinkt so so it's and is that part of the front lawn um
3:19:20
the septic vegetated front sep here this is where the field is there there are
3:19:27
trees we're keeping as many as possible um so the graded portion is
3:19:32
where the septic is going yes that's where the septic is okay I just want how visible it is from the street I'm trying
3:19:37
to get a sense right so is the house sight higher than the street or lower than the street the house is higher
3:19:44
okay and set back about 140
3:19:49
ft um yeah it's not really going to be that visible from the street no it will
3:19:55
not is there um significant foliage in the front yard um there is actually um
3:20:03
there is a very wooden site um anything we can maintain um outside
3:20:11
of the septic field will
3:20:18
yeah any other thoughts questions board well I mean St the obvious the
3:20:25
style of the house does not really fit in with most of the other properties there the there in the area the house is set back a long way it's got trees
3:20:32
around it there are actually a couple of Fairly modern houses up on Mountain Lane
3:20:37
now yeah the owner did another one particularly particularly across the
3:20:43
street number 50 is quite modern there's it's a very eclectic Street actually it
3:20:50
it actually I'm thinking back on what 50 looks like right now I'm actually yeah yeah this is sort of the mod section of
3:20:56
Beacon this is kind of where I think it looks lovely yeah yeah very nice
3:21:03
proportions for modern house well kind of like we was saying too when you you got a little bit of space around you
3:21:08
some of these concerns get a little less yeah especially the distance in the sidelines okay um I'll accept a motion
3:21:15
to approve motion second second oh uh motion by David second by I'll give it
3:21:20
to I'll give it to Kevin yeah all right uh all in favor I mean uh all in favor I
3:21:27
lost my place there thank you thank you you're welcome to grab your samples although I got up
3:21:34
sorry no that's okay all right uh next item on the
3:21:41
agenda is um certificate of appropriateness 17 to 19 South Avenue
3:21:47
facade says something to do with Windows I understand it does Mr chairman good
3:21:53
evening um Brad schwar in the law firm of Zar and stats we represent the church um I'm joined tonight by Joe harberson
3:22:00
the vice ch dasis um um father Chuck Kramer who is on a job really for what
3:22:07
11 days I believe um Al Capell architect of my associate Vincent pone um so as I
3:22:13
mentioned in our cover letter we're here to remedy a notice of violation that was issued to the church due to the removal
3:22:20
of Tiffany stained glass windows um without achieving a COA first um as I
3:22:27
explained the windows were removed um in an effort to raise some funds that would help support the improvements at the
3:22:34
Walcott Avenue location um the church did not know that an approval was
3:22:39
required I I don't have a better story than that the church just didn't know nor nor did the consultant um and so
3:22:45
we're here to work together with the city to to fix the problem um we do have some pictures to show but I
3:22:51
think I could quickly summarize this as I did in my letter there were a total of six Windows removed four on the South
3:22:58
Side very simple we're going to put them back they haven't been sold yet they're going right back in one window on the west west side
3:23:06
facing 9d St Andrew that window was moved over to the Walcott campus um and
3:23:12
the other window the sixth one was removed and sold to the historic Society so there are two windows that do need to
3:23:18
be replaced with something else um and what we're proposing is to install a
3:23:24
replica um the there would be an exact image placed on lexan which is essentially plexiglass the geometric
3:23:31
geometric pattern and the colors would look exactly the same so from anyone observing the building from the exterior
3:23:38
no one would even notice a difference about one quick question the beacon historical society was the purchaser of
3:23:43
the one the one window you're referencing I'm sorry not the St Andrew one of the side one of the smaller side
3:23:49
window was the beacon Historical Society right yes they are in receipt of the Contraband and they're not they're not
3:23:54
I'm just kind of they're not willing to just relinquish it undo the sale to restore the building fabric back to what
3:24:00
it was Teresa ran out of here she just ran out of here real quick I can chase
3:24:05
her down I'll see her walking my dog she can't hide from me forever you know it's like give it back Teresa just saying of all people she
3:24:12
should know better yeah I'm kind of surprised that it can't be undone doesn't seem like I mean given who the
3:24:18
parties are and Silence from the
3:24:25
attorney um okay candidly it is it is not something that we have raised um the
3:24:32
transaction has occurred so I'm I'm not sure if that could all be unraveled um well if it were able to be
3:24:40
that would be optimal um I'm just curious what so and so and the other windows at St Luke's yes
3:24:47
yeah also I mean conceivably but that's where that their main congregation is now so that's I I
3:24:56
kind of understand but at the same time is there certainly can't be undone is
3:25:01
there an example of the lexan in any of these photographs which one is it so
3:25:08
it's towards the end um the consultant church services group that's an example of before and after of a church in
3:25:15
Scranton Pennsylvania which one which is it the one the closeup with the Sheep No let me
3:25:22
approach no that that's a good show is it a purely geometric window
3:25:28
without any figural or painted panels the one that's being
3:25:35
reproduced this is it here which those three a row yeah these
3:25:40
three right here with the Alpha and Omega turn around you see yeah so these are those are the replicas is what
3:25:47
you're saying okay the hang on those are okay so on either side or
3:25:55
but sounds like all three of them yes so the so so wait these are examples of an
3:26:01
example of another Pennsylvania where this company has done this type of work before got it the windows that are to be
3:26:08
reproduced yes do they have any figural or painted elements or are they purely
3:26:13
geometrical purely geometrical ah
3:26:18
that's that's pretty good job and they're going to they're this is
3:26:26
the if I could approach this isure from this church I'm not a judge so just come
3:26:31
on up 11:00 anything go right so this is just another example of the restoration
3:26:37
work that they that they perform so
3:26:43
it's yeah okay um so to do great work um it's
3:26:52
actually there's a I've learned more about replicating stained glass windows than I ever would have imagined in my entire legal career there's a there's
3:26:59
like a factory in Alabama which is where the work gets done it's a completely onedimensional replica right I I mean I
3:27:05
I worked for four years in an Art Glass Studio during college I worked for an aror Glass Works is a bler I made a ton
3:27:12
of let windows I restored them these are ond and wallet 2D it's it's a it's a
3:27:18
decal right between a couple layers of glass you're not going to see the dimensionality of the lead you're not going to see the texture of the of the
3:27:26
glass which this stuff has texture and yes we can describe this as the best of
3:27:31
a bad situation is it really the best of that because I mean it Len we're not going to we're not going to convince
3:27:37
them that they can't get approved because they can't get the windows back I mean it's just not something we can saying it's only one window that they
3:27:43
conceivably can't get back and the other ones just been relocated across town and still in their possession and I'm just I
3:27:50
guess I'm just asking the board you know what's the what was the intent of the of the preservation of this building and
3:27:55
I'm not trying to be a jerk but I'm just saying you know
3:28:03
it's it's not impossible and and the the Historical Society thing that might be
3:28:08
able to be ironed out too I mean I just I understand think a little effort maybe a little it was an inadvertent situation
3:28:15
right so you know of course ignorance is no excuse right but still it was
3:28:20
inadvertently done but it seems like it could almost be entirely undone it can
3:28:26
be but we are asking for permission for the for the two right so the four we are undoing it by putting them right back
3:28:32
and so we are asking for Relief on the two one that would facilitate the religious worship at Walcott Avenue and
3:28:38
the second one so is not to unravel if it could even be done the the one to the Historical
3:28:45
Society we think we're making a really good faith effort and frankly in in reinstalling the four um we had even
3:28:51
talked internally do we just replace with a frosted glass that's in place now and we talked as a team and and the church wants to really be a good
3:28:57
neighbor and um get on a good path with the city and do the right thing and so simply put the four back that were taken
3:29:05
out go against the wishes of the worshippers but it just seems to be borderline idolatry to be that focused
3:29:12
on a window in your place of worship I it depends your uh what your faith is
3:29:18
right it's yeah look you Len yes you're not being a jerk you make a very good
3:29:25
point it would be optimal if somehow there were arrangements made but you know the practicalities of the financial
3:29:32
implications the financial implications to the church obviously you know there's reasons why the sale was made um so you
3:29:41
know you're getting into a territory where but I mean I understand the need for this I mean I understand the
3:29:46
economic reasons for the sale the only problem was is that it was in contravention of a get it we remedy that right ideally
3:29:55
for the church they would have sold all four and we wouldn't right so so they we put a as soon as we learned about this we put a stop to all additional sales
3:30:02
and we want to fix it and do right I'm so curious I don't I want to ask but I don't want to know I mean how just how
3:30:08
much these windows go for I mean they're Tiffany anyway David another way of looking at this is simply if they came
3:30:15
in here on application saying we want to change out two of these windows because we don't want the religious figures and that makes the most sense to do these
3:30:22
lexan reproductions would we have even been here this long talking about
3:30:29
it they're asking me I don't know I think if it that was the application it would be a little more straightforward
3:30:36
yeah can I can I make a comment oh yes please if you if you do me favor yeah
3:30:41
just speak in the mic I'm L shorter uh Joseph harberson um I'm the Vice Chancellor I live in Yonkers I don't
3:30:48
think you need my specific address I I am also a lawyer and I have been practicing for 45 years to answer your
3:30:54
question the money that they got to um for the one that they did sell is being
3:31:01
used to put in a handicapped bathroom at the other church and and I just want to State just for the record I live right
3:31:07
across the street from St luks and I I came out way before I was on the planning board I came out and supported
3:31:12
the school at the accessory building I'm is it off uh sorry uh I was going to say
3:31:19
yeah I live right across the street from St Luke's long before I was on the planning board I I came out and supported the school use the accessory
3:31:24
building because I wanted to see the campus be able to get funding and help with maintenance and upkeep and I
3:31:30
certainly support the the um for that facility to thrive okay thank but yeah
3:31:37
so understood and my daughter went to school there um
3:31:46
so yeah look I understanding the request understanding the circumstances having a
3:31:54
sense that though not optimal the effort as far as the replications is being made um I'm in
3:32:03
support of this yes same yeah I have to support
3:32:10
well I think it's a good faith effort and I'm glad that you're uh um appreciate the Heritage that you guys
3:32:15
have left to the community of U incredibly Rich architecture even though
3:32:21
you're not using the space that that has its own value and and because you're a Faith organization and have um uh part
3:32:30
of that's part of your mission and I appreciate that effort thank you so then I will um accept a motion to approve
3:32:39
this uh application motion motion by David second second by Karen all in
3:32:45
favor I I I I okay great unanimous thank you while I'm here I'll be 30 seconds there
3:32:51
was one other window the Good Shepherd window which you notice in the pictures that that needs repair that we have not
3:32:58
touched right we stopped everything while the notice of violation was issued um it's something that maybe we'll talk to the building department about we
3:33:04
think that there's an exception under the code for that kind of routine repair and maintenance um so that's something
3:33:09
that CH we could we could talk with the building department just like a clarification that we could take that window out repair it make take four to
3:33:16
six weeks and then put it back and that doesn't require a COA yeah these guys that's these guys good night yes thank
3:33:22
you good night thanks nobody told me how much these things are though they're not
3:33:28
and the value the value of a handicapp bathroom you can figure that out on couple of tens of thousands so we need
3:33:34
to talk about what are you still doing here oh yes we didn't did we yeah oh we
3:33:40
have to go don't we have to go into executive session now we have an interested
3:33:46
party okay so let's just get back to the um zoning map did we finish that
3:33:53
conversation yeah I think the takeaways were asking for additional information looking at comparing the LI to the CMS
3:34:00
to the GB in terms of both use and dimensions and then I was also thinking about kind of doing a site visit and
3:34:05
kind of trying to think about Max buildout under those various zoning districts so you could contemplate that
3:34:11
okay oh well Russo SK outled quickly didn't he
3:34:16
to do trainings have to stay till the end I'm not going to let it go be nice to be the engineer yeah me CRA comes in
3:34:24
complaining about coffee leaves early black and white all right so we have
3:34:29
another really fun law to opine on for the benefit of the
3:34:36
city council and so perhaps Jen if you walk us through this one sure I will
3:34:42
walk you through this um yeah so this is another local law referral from the city
3:34:48
council uh the city council has proposed a local law that would do two things one
3:34:53
it would prohibit um self- storage facilities in the city of Beacon and
3:35:00
also prohibit drive-thru facilities an accessory um in all in all zones in all
3:35:08
zones um I was at the workshop meeting when the city council
3:35:15
first introduced this local law and um one of the questions that came up that
3:35:21
didn't end up in the specific referral resolution to you but the city council discussed wanting to ask you uh with
3:35:28
respect to the self storage facilities is is there they were struggling to
3:35:33
figure out is there a place in the city where self- storage facilities should be
3:35:39
permitted um it seemed like they were were struggling between prohibiting him altogether um or trying to find a
3:35:47
particular location um in the city where they might be appropriate fish Killen I
3:35:52
know we have some we do on in the LI district and I'm glad you mentioned that because you're talking about the old
3:35:58
bowling we received so they wanted to know from you what do you think about
3:36:03
where they should be located if at all in the city and the second thing um
3:36:10
because David brought up uh that you do have existing self storage facilities in Beacon is we received late today a
3:36:17
letter from cutting fader from Jennifer vantile um who as you remember representative beacon hippops on on
3:36:24
their various applications there is a self storage facility at hips right that would be rendered non-conforming
3:36:30
obviously if um they were prohibited throughout so pofs is in the LI District
3:36:36
that was in an existing structure right thing it's like right right behind Grille an important thing to think about
3:36:42
too I think yeah well it and Beacon and that has Self Storage right that
3:36:48
building behind I'm saying the on both of these it this is really
3:36:54
striken me a lot of uh as not in my backyard stuff I mean it do we have a
3:37:01
demand for the storage facilities um reasonable Minds can differ on
3:37:08
whether or not we should have drive-throughs in my opinion kind of I gave it some thought at
3:37:13
length especially fish Hill Avenue probably makes sense now related issue
3:37:20
which I referenced before but I don't want to let this go because on this one I don't think it's a reasonable L different thing if the city wants to
3:37:29
prohibit drive-thru restaurants the approach they're taking now is okay if
3:37:34
you look at the current zoning code the fact that you have drive-throughs allowed in two areas and otherwise not
3:37:42
addressed gets me to a pretty clear legal result but everywhere else it's not allowed if you delete the two places
3:37:50
where it's allowed as is proposed maybe it becomes a little more arguable but I don't really think it's
3:37:56
that arguable the approach they're taking is deleting those two provisions and then adding a new provision that
3:38:03
says all uses not permitted or disallowed which is implicitly the way
3:38:08
the entire zoning code's already set up that is making a large scale interpretive change and we're going to
3:38:14
wind up here in the future going oh yeah but they didn't really mean what the law says they were just trying to make
3:38:20
drive-throughs illegal so if the goal is make drive-throughs illegal say drive-throughs are a prohibited use
3:38:27
whether it's primary or accessory whatever but that is in the use table right you saw that in the use table that
3:38:33
drive-through facilities are added as an accessory use within the use table and then there's an X across all districts
3:38:39
oh I'm sorry I did not see that part of it there's a yeah there was anend so there's the language the text of the
3:38:44
code and then there was a um I guess I'm trying to look what do being amended as attachment to the table use table was
3:38:51
updated regardless what I say just I would not suggest adopting that interpret change because the only
3:38:57
reasonable way to construe that like as a judge sitting there separated from the
3:39:03
facts which is the way these things ultimately get interpreted is city council must have intended to have made
3:39:09
some change by passing that are you saying there' be unint Ed
3:39:16
situations where you wouldn't have flexibility or where the suggestion would be that city council was saying we
3:39:22
want the zoning Cod to be applied more strictly than it's been applied in the past what you were doing right now even
3:39:28
though it was already implicitly uses that are not permitted or disallowed wasn't enough we're now
3:39:35
expressly saying if a use isn't permitted it's disallowed if we think there's any like
3:39:42
language doubt about whether or not 3es are prohibited just prohibit them it's it's better than coming up with a wide
3:39:50
ranging provision that could have I'll let Jennifer speak to this I think that's traditional language in most
3:39:55
codes right it's just like it's actually just how zoning is reviewed by right
3:40:01
like if if it's not there listed it's not permitted so you're stating I think
3:40:07
think the memorialize the basic zoning principle that all uses that aren't for
3:40:15
the avoidance of any doubt IMA that provision and say city council does this
3:40:20
to clarify it in the way it's it's understanding of the way the zoning code currently applies whatever but language
3:40:27
that makes it clear you're not actually making a change part part of the reason this may have come up I don't know I was in I didn't listen to every discussion
3:40:33
in Council but uh there were a lot of uses which people were uncomfortable
3:40:39
with that came up it was like could that be interpreted as right as as being
3:40:44
allowed because because it's the definition of it isn't clear to me you know how how are all these things
3:40:49
defined not every use is defined in a definition Clause right right so I remember one of the examples I think
3:40:55
Paloma brought it up was like what about a supermarket like do we have is a supermarket listed um or is that
3:41:02
something that's now going to be prohibited and the response there is it's it's a retail use I mean so there's
3:41:08
a lot of things like that that are actually already taken care of in the
3:41:14
zoning code um but just not explicitly listed as you know Supermarket bookstore
3:41:20
um but I was trying to understand like why why the uncertainty that people you know when they're especially reading
3:41:26
that uh they can think of situations where that interpretation
3:41:31
is up to you know is in contention or gets argued or whatever I think it happened with drive-thru right because
3:41:38
drive-thru was not a listed use it wasn't in the accessory use table it wasn't in the permitted use table the
3:41:44
only place drive-thru came up in the code was in two in the linkage district and the CMS District right where it's
3:41:50
expressly said it was prohibited there and so I think there was confusion right right and so the the standard of if it's
3:41:58
not listed it's not permitted it was not you know that was
3:42:03
not applied at that or it wasn't um that wasn't clearly stated in the code so but the catchall provision of the if uh you
3:42:11
know customary and incidental um accessory yeah true yeah so you know you
3:42:16
can have accessory uses for a principal use that are not all explicitly listed
3:42:23
because there's a catchall provision that says any accessory that's you know customary and incidental to the
3:42:29
principal is a permitted accessory use you don't have to enumerate every single
3:42:34
but having work type of accessory use with zoning in New York City right there are times when because it's not reviewed
3:42:41
there in the same way it's internal and administrative that there was a whole period of time in the 90s where those
3:42:48
interpretations were stretched to what ended up being like um uh sanctioned the
3:42:56
extent let's say um so uh you have to be careful like it's it's a uh with
3:43:03
interpretations especially when they're not you know when they're uh maybe not popular right but
3:43:11
that's why we have there's you know there's a chain of command where the building inspector ctor is charged
3:43:16
legally with the responsibility of interpreting the code and then there's an appeals process from that uh to the
3:43:21
zoning board of appeals so so the larger issue is what do we think about prohibiting drive-throughs and storage
3:43:28
units um because I think that's kind of the can they actually intended to get to
3:43:33
us right what's the use well uh first of all I just want to say that I think that
3:43:40
uh temporary storage is a totally nonbeneficial use in the city a beacon
3:43:46
and it provides very little benefit it's provided in other places nearby everybody has to use a car to get to it
3:43:51
anyway doesn't need to be with it local and close by so that's just one as far
3:43:57
as that goes I wouldn't consider it a necessary uh or uh it could easily be um
3:44:04
not permitted and it wouldn't uh it wouldn't inconvenience anyone uh
3:44:11
driveway Drive-In I actually I'm not 100% sure about to be quite honest you know there are people that are very
3:44:18
opposed to it and it has to do with a series of other
3:44:23
um uh uh uh like ideals about how uh we should
3:44:30
use land in general right not just specifically about individual uses but about how how uh um uh we should more
3:44:39
efficiently or uh uh environmentally you know thoughtfully
3:44:46
um promote land use right and
3:44:51
uh when you're in on fiscal Avenue now it would be hard to imagine that it's
3:44:58
going to make much of a difference right but I I I think the intent was to
3:45:04
uh uh uh to gradually over time and maybe
3:45:10
more quickly when there's consensus and a process is finalized that that um uh
3:45:17
uh in the city that the the the kinds of low value unpleasant
3:45:25
car dominated land uses that occur in some places in the city that were
3:45:30
encouraged and almost required during the 70s when everyone had to it seemed like we had to transform our cities into
3:45:37
parking lots with buildings in the middle of them or the shopping malls uh U is uh absolutely something to reported
3:45:45
by the comprehensive plan and I think a lot of people would agree all and the market agrees all the most valuable
3:45:51
places are pedestrian oriented you know uh but is it strategic what's the you know
3:45:59
I'll say this um probably fish Avenue is the only place that would that is appropriate for drive-thru in
3:46:05
Beacon but it's it's a short stretch right that that I mean I think
3:46:11
drive-throughs are more appropriate for larger you know kind of light Highway
3:46:18
areas like Route 9 or areas where there's already a lot of vehicle traffic and I feel like my only my only problem
3:46:24
with drive-throughs is stacked up idling cars um if you're in if I guess on my my
3:46:32
thought is like if you're in a borderline place where you're getting closer to residential areas or mixed use
3:46:37
areas that they're not ideal you know if they're they're kind of in a in a very
3:46:42
heavily builtup kind of Highway Zone but yeah so I'm not I don't think I
3:46:47
don't think drive-throughs are the greatest use in Beacon I think we're a little bit we've only got really that
3:46:53
one stretch where they're where they're appropriate and it's it's a short stretch with potential for
3:46:58
transformation I amum yeah I think I personally think that there are
3:47:04
appropriate districts for each uh self storage and drive-through and I agree
3:47:09
with you I think 52 is one of those zones where drive-thru is appropriate I also think
3:47:18
where we currently have self storage that's appropriate so I think we want to be a little bit more specific about what
3:47:24
the zones are the city that would be my recommendation where these uses are
3:47:29
appropriate rather than make a wholesale um restriction I am fascinated
3:47:36
that Farms are allowed in all R1 districts there was a proposal to put in
3:47:43
a a Cooperative Farm where hiddenbrook is at one time it turns out there was moist soil and whatnot but that was that
3:47:49
was city- owned land and they were going to do a uh because it was in a city and people could see it they walk by it it
3:47:55
was I think um sorry yeah please um I agree I I'm not um I'm not um a
3:48:04
supporter of the blanket outlawing of the uses I think really it comes down to
3:48:12
um uh I I I think the diversity of uses I think we have cars we're going to need
3:48:19
auto repair shops I'd rather be able to walk to an auto repair shop then have to drive to another town for an auto repair
3:48:26
shop I don't use self storage but I know apparently a lot of people do so again I
3:48:33
think the one that we have in town is well cited
3:48:38
um so I think maybe it's looking at the corridor of 52 the short Corridor at
3:48:44
that it is and thinking about you know the zoning of it and where can we like
3:48:52
put these within that zone like maybe it's not along the entire stretch of 52
3:48:58
um yeah cuz it is a short Carter and I'm saying imagine imagine that short card a 52 with a Wendy's and McDonald's and the
3:49:05
Duncan drive-thru on it do you like it now that's that's my take is like if you know maybe one is fine but if you like
3:49:13
you had three of them you know would you be I feel like it would then kind of
3:49:19
dominate it you know and and uh it might not be really what you want I agree with you out of that zone yeah I agree with
3:49:25
you on that for sure I mean I think it's really about the the the the mixture of
3:49:31
things you know I like the fact that on verplank there's an auto repair shop that you can walk to it's one in the
3:49:37
neighbor you know being able to walk back or get bicyc back my bicycle in the
3:49:43
back of my car fre and B back yeah there's random weird uses scattered along around the city and
3:49:51
it gives it character you know and we need places also for you know we need
3:49:56
light industrial we need workshops we need people you know we need to diversify the tax base and not just rely
3:50:04
on residential can I I I I I'm I'm up two minds and I am listening to what
3:50:10
you're saying because one of there's two strategies that I've heard about one of them is sort of like very u a little bit
3:50:17
um goes against the grain which is to uh uh not encourage any improvements on
3:50:23
Fishkill Avenue right make sure that it's a low value and low rent place that people that are gentrified out of Main
3:50:30
Street can locate there right so do minor infrastructure improvements right
3:50:35
any improvements you're spending on it's public money that's spending like improve uh helping out just a few large
3:50:41
tenants right and you're not really creating a value for for the whole city of Beacon right that the economic that a
3:50:47
low value economic location there I mean the example is like Roman Nova had to
3:50:53
leave uh their place and they could find a place in Beacon and they're there and they're still making those great tacos
3:50:59
you know and I can you can go there it's very close there's another argument the other strategy is to uh it's a it's kind of a
3:51:07
lift right to improve that whole District right it's there's a lot of planning effort there's a lot of
3:51:13
Cooperative effort there's a zoning there has to be a coordinated zoning effort in order for it to all cohere as
3:51:19
something that is um has like an a more urban and uh uh a safer pedestrian
3:51:28
experience right which which would be much better right be better for the property owners it' be be better for the
3:51:34
people in Beacon but it would also be more expensive it would necessarily one of the things that would give you that
3:51:40
the the tax income all these other Financial things would be improved so that's almost like a fundamental
3:51:47
decision you know that and one of those choices really hasn't been discussed very much which is the let it let it
3:51:54
just sort of like be an inexpensive low rent district that uh because nobody
3:52:00
really a lot of people would prefer everything to look better around here you know you want your neighbor you know
3:52:06
you want your uh your environment to be better you know to improve it but there's there's an impact on
3:52:12
that and I wouldn't say that in a public hearing necessarily but that those are
3:52:18
those are two different ways you you just said it in a very public forum it's on the record on record are you going to
3:52:24
put y okay um you did it now okay I thought the ARB I thought after that it
3:52:32
wasn't audience so so what are we saying consensus yeah I yeah I want to get to
3:52:37
a before the clock strikes 11: I want to get to a
3:52:42
uh you know compile our thoughts for the council whether they listen or not it's a different story but I should In
3:52:48
fairness I should also mention we also did receive um from cutting fader a
3:52:54
letter on drive-throughs so we received one on Self Storage today and we
3:52:59
received another one on drive-throughs uh a couple weeks ago and you were all copied on that as much as
3:53:05
I'm unhappy that I have it I have a self storage unit at uh I guess it's hip lffs or whatever behind Grille yeah don't
3:53:12
want it but you could suggest special permit regulations potentially fathering
3:53:17
certain projects or something that or separating out drive or restaurants like
3:53:23
Len mentioned like Wendy's McDonald's and others versus like a coffee shop there are ways to manage and mitigate
3:53:29
those concerns reg yeah I thought we didn't have an audience yeah really jez
3:53:34
another thing too sort of like a Jiminy Cricket right drivethru have been permitted
3:53:39
along Fish Creek sorry at at all what's that Avenue sorry for fish kill Avenue
3:53:46
pardon me drive-throughs have been permitted along fish kill Avenue at all material points in time and this is the
3:53:51
first time someone's talking about building one so I mean yeah we could wind up with 20 of them in 10 years it's
3:53:58
I don't really have any great reason to think that's going to happen well I but I think that there was a you know auto
3:54:06
dealership kind of use that was just glommed up all the property right there was nothing was available to come
3:54:11
through and and nobody wanted to rezone that because it was if it becomes a problem we can can revisit this in the
3:54:17
future I mean right now it seems like we're just sort of it's a bit reactionary not great Optics although
3:54:25
for the record to be fair this was discussed by the committee prior to this application coming before the board Fair
3:54:31
as someone who sits with the committee and discussion so I say reactionary in regard to the application I would say
3:54:36
reactionary in that we don't really seem to actually have much of a basis for doing this other than a generalized I
3:54:41
don't like cars type thing right but it's also clear that the planning board has been proceeding a pace with the
3:54:48
application just you know without consideration of possible future laws
3:54:54
we've been just doing our doing what we do yeah yeah and I think just to to to
3:55:00
respond to David I think this is coming from public the committee's recommendation right I'm just going to read to them because right now we're
3:55:06
only talking about drivethru so what they said is the committee has similar concerns talking about self storage with
3:55:11
drive-through component that uses typically focus on autoc Centric designed and are considered detrimental to pedestrian safety because they often
3:55:17
create congested traffic patterns with cars entering and exiting at various angles leading to increase risk of
3:55:23
collisions with pedestrians an evolution of the quarter again Evolution from what it is now uh with this type of use is
3:55:29
not consistent with the overall pedestrian scale Vision that the committee is working towards the committee recommends that drive-through
3:55:35
facilities stand alone or used in connection with any other uses be expressly prohibited within all zoning
3:55:40
districts along the fishal Avenue Corridor so just to give you a little bit like they're not just saying we hate cars right um in terms of what they're
3:55:47
thinking about when they're looking at this Corridor so I just wanted to read that that was the language that went to the council that then informed their
3:55:53
consideration of this just so you have that with you well stated um on the one
3:55:59
hand I'm thinking you know city council is going to do what they're going to do right so they're
3:56:05
looking for a feedback I love when they a legislative body includes the administrative body in their decision
3:56:12
making I mean yeah this is this is based on public
3:56:18
input it's been considered by the city council um what do we want to share with
3:56:25
the city council about the board's position on these two laws What specifically can we limit can we limit
3:56:32
the use to a portion of a Zone without prohibiting it entirely so kind of like shrink the the footprint
3:56:39
available well you specific sit Zing a Zone where it's allow
3:56:44
or you could even within a zoning District if you can Define you know let's say the GB District right if the
3:56:51
GB District um if you want to allow self storage facilities in the GB District
3:56:57
but only for lots that front Fishkill Avenue or something along those lines you could do that um but you'd have to
3:57:03
be able to describe the location back to my original point it's it's it's you know
3:57:11
they're they're they're looking to act on this soon my feeling and sounds like the rest
3:57:17
of the board agrees I don't want to put words in your mouth but that to do this right it really needs more consideration
3:57:23
to the level that you're you just described that's what I would say to the
3:57:29
council and I wouldn't I wouldn't necessarily twist ourselves up about how exactly to do
3:57:36
that you know you know I wouldn't prescribe it to them yeah I mean and I
3:57:42
agree I'm not disagreeing with John but what their intent was there are some things we are afraid of or we have we
3:57:49
have concerns about that we uh that seem to be of immediate concern because of uh
3:57:55
recent occurrences development that's not the reason to do it i' I'm not disagreeing with you I'm just saying
3:58:01
that this is that there were a few specific things that they were considering and again so for that reason
3:58:07
Kevin they're going to do what they're going to do regardless so we have this moment only to to share our thoughts
3:58:14
with them and let me throw out one other idea um in in all seriousness because I kind of frankly personally agree with
3:58:21
this idea that we they should probably have a little more information um one option would be to do
3:58:28
some sort of a moratorium while more information is developed and until a permanent decision
3:58:35
is made throwing that out there would be one more yeah I mean we could we could
3:58:41
as a board recommend that again they're going to do what they're going to do whether they take that more information though I missed that piece what is the
3:58:48
it's the ability to look more closely at certain districts for these specific
3:58:54
uses and where they might be appropriate and and identifying them and and you
3:59:01
know incorporating them into this new legislation I mean particularly we've
3:59:07
got traffic consultants and I don't I I genuinely don't know to what extent they were involved with the committee by a
3:59:15
lot of the concerns we're talking about are traffic related concerns we should probably be leaning on them yeah I agree
3:59:21
I mean to me again it just comes down to it feels like something like this needs more just like the other law we were looking at need more consideration more
3:59:28
study more thought um and not for you know Naval gazing sake but to actually
3:59:34
get it right and not be so Broad and sweeping the existing self- storage facility at
3:59:41
hip lofs is in the LI District but where else do we have Li districts we have one East Main right we just talked about
3:59:47
that with the other local law um there's an Li district there well I made the
3:59:53
same the river like would those be appropriate locations had the Pres from
3:59:58
storage facilities canish or is it more limited um to only
4:00:04
certain Li District areas or other you know other zoning
4:00:10
districts there are heavy industry districts yep also I mean if you want to be more more focused or in a way
4:00:18
um uh more U more restrictive in reality
4:00:24
you know right I mean there is the whole um
4:00:29
r140 District out past the high school that you know that
4:00:34
could seems like could be used for for Farms or late
4:00:42
industry I I feel like it it it warrants a a larger look and a closer look yeah
4:00:51
well said so is there is that enough for you Jen to craft something meaningful I
4:00:57
think on behalf of our robust August committee I what what the chairman
4:01:03
described uh with kind of you needing a little bit more time and more information is that the
4:01:10
consensus it sounds like I I see the point of wanting to them to
4:01:17
deal with concerns specific concerns that have to do with um um you see the
4:01:26
point things are happening as we speak let's say timely you know I I understand
4:01:31
that is what I'm saying they're not necessarily Mally exclusive I mean it no no but but but
4:01:38
it's it's a it's uncertain time and an uncertain um uh outcome to do a uh uh
4:01:45
code change new zones all those other things that are would be contemplated in order to do it correctly right and and I
4:01:53
just think that there's there was concerns about these things and whether those concerns are important is another issue right there the way I look the
4:02:01
option of doing the moratorium sorry don't talk over me please go Ahad that's all I was going to
4:02:07
say just that one sentence okay um I think it would probably be fair to
4:02:14
say correct me if Am I Wrong generally stated most of us had some concerns with
4:02:20
a categorical prohibition yeah agreed I think that's that's one way to um share
4:02:25
our deliberations back to the board to make a more focused
4:02:30
recommendation um you know we would want to look at different zoning districts
4:02:36
and different areas within zoning districts to be more targeted yeah again
4:02:43
who knows whether that that's going to be effective if they have their timeline they have their timeline um but if
4:02:49
they're again if they're asking of the board what our thoughts
4:02:54
are our thoughts are just that that we think that the city
4:02:59
needs regardless of other extenuating circumstances in order to do something
4:03:05
like this they need the time to look at this more
4:03:11
closely uh in order to get it
4:03:18
right and hopefully they watch our planning board
4:03:24
meetings anyway is that enough I think so
4:03:29
basosi
4:03:34
all motion motion to adjourn motion motion
4:03:39
by Karen seconded second by Len All In
