# Beacon Planning Board Meeting Summary - March 11, 2025

## Workshop Session (0:00:00 - 0:28:45)

### City Council Request to Review Proposed Local Law to Amend the City Zoning Map for East Main Street

**Discussion:** The Planning Board reviewed a proposed rezoning of 1 East Main Street from Light Industrial (LI) district to Central Main Street (CMS) district. The proposal originated from former Building Inspector Bruce Flower, who identified inconsistencies between current uses at the property (multi-family dwelling and coffee shop) and LI zoning, which prohibits both uses. The property contains condo units with ground-floor commercial space.

**Concerns:**
- Changing to CMS would make 22 use changes, while changing to GB (General Business) would only change 8 uses
- Dimensional requirements in CMS might not be appropriate for this location since it's separated from Main Street by railroad tracks
- CMS allows for zero setbacks and reduced open space requirements, which might not be suitable
- Potential future redevelopment if buildings were destroyed would follow different standards

**Next Steps:** The Board's recommendation to the City Council is that while switching from LI to CMS seems appropriate from a use perspective, more study is needed regarding dimensional requirements and how redevelopment might impact the character of the area. The Board suggested examining GB zoning as an alternative or simply modifying the LI zone to allow the current uses.

## Miscellaneous Business

### City Council Request to Review Proposed Local Law Concerning Drive-Through Facilities and Self-Storage Businesses

**Discussion:** The Planning Board reviewed the City Council's proposed regulations for drive-through facilities and self-storage businesses. Key points discussed included:

- Drive-through facilities: The Board examined proposed requirements for stacking lanes, traffic circulation, speaker systems, and landscaping buffers. Board members noted that drive-throughs should be limited to specific commercial districts like the highway commercial zone, with adequate setbacks from residential areas to minimize noise and light impacts.

- Self-storage businesses: The Board discussed appropriate locations for these facilities, emphasizing they should be restricted to highway commercial and light industrial zones. Members agreed that design standards should require these facilities to blend with surrounding architecture rather than using standardized corporate designs.

**Recommendations to City Council:** The Planning Board's feedback included supporting the proposed restrictions on locations for both types of businesses, recommending enhanced landscaping requirements for drive-through facilities to mitigate impacts on neighboring properties, and suggesting strengthened architectural standards to ensure these businesses contribute positively to Beacon's character. The Board recommended the City Council proceed with the local law with these considerations incorporated.
