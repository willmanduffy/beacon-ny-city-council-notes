2:41:47
know uh section of that building that you know he he was sort of reducing
2:41:52
that part as far as he could so we're we're still looking at a twostory um we submitted updated site
2:41:59
plan and Landscape plan and we also provided
2:42:05
um uh the photo realistic rendering so you get a better idea of what it looks
2:42:11
like in context with uh you know with the neighboring buildings what is that
2:42:22
so yeah so here you can see it you know in relation to the car wash and and the uh existing telephone
2:42:28
building and you know so so what we did by you know keeping it a two stories the
2:42:35
existing Cornus on the telephone building is maintained all the way around um you know depending on where
2:42:40
you're standing you'd see more or less of it but you know we felt that it
2:42:46
was an approach to uh adding on to the building we we also got a letter um from
2:42:52
shipo I I don't know do you get that or did that just State historic preservation
2:42:59
organization uh I don't recall seeing that in our email not in our package it
2:43:04
it came to uh my you know Bo indor office and we're looking at that they
2:43:10
also included a copy of um the preser preservation brief 14 from the National
2:43:16
Park Service which uh you know I spoke about at the first meeting that we had about this um it's it's sort of the
2:43:23
guideline document for adding on to historic buildings and um the the way
2:43:29
that you know this new approach sort of follows those guidelines that with
2:43:36
um set it back keep it smaller have that little hyphen glass connection you know
2:43:42
all all those points are things that they bring up uh specifically in their guidance document um you so we're trying
2:43:50
to work with that um AR it sounds like Mercedes didn't get a copy of that from shipo um
2:43:56
if you could submit that okay yeah to us that would be great all right and and then I I've responded to that so I'll
2:44:03
I'll get the response that put into the record perfect along with the document okay thank you
2:44:11
um so we we also um provided a landscaping plan uh from Hudson land
2:44:19
designs office and updated the site plan
2:44:25
somewhat you know so one of the things we wanted to talk about was you also how to deal with that back section it's a
2:44:32
it's a interesting site because it kind of wraps around the building it doesn't touch the building in the back and the
2:44:39
and that entire side street is um residential property so you know with
2:44:45
this approach we're looking at it more like a um you know something that would reflect
2:44:51
the nature of the Residential Properties with the gable roof the the other option would be to you know continue the idea
2:44:59
of how Main Street you know was looked at and and have it be more like
2:45:05
the the telephone building itself and not relate as much to the residential
2:45:11
property um and you know the other thing we we did take um the
2:45:19
suggestions that that uh the board made at the last meeting about you know we we adjusted that
2:45:25
column in in the corner uh flattened out the roof on the
2:45:32
um you know in the three-story section which is beyond the where where the
2:45:38
existing building uh ends back there and you know so so basically the
2:45:46
the applicant wants to you know follow this approach on Main Street and then sort of get your feedback on the uh
2:45:52
other you know the side street portion of
2:45:57
it anything else uh let's um let's start with our
2:46:06
Consultants um Natalie your review anything specific you want to point out
2:46:11
for the board of the applicant um yep I can go through the points quickly y uh mechanical equipment
2:46:19
um there in the cover letter I think it was stated that it's going to be located on the flat roof of the third story
2:46:24
section um and screen so just asking for that note to be placed on the actual
2:46:29
site plan set and potentially a detail of whatever the screening material is um Landscaping
2:46:38
plan I do appreciate the addition of the Landscaping along Brett um I guess again
2:46:45
this was a little bit of an issue between rendering and the plan that I think there's going to be a vehicle
2:46:50
parked outside on the on the kind of the more residential looking building um
2:46:56
facing umbr Bret this looks like all the all the vehicles are parked underneath the building but based on the site plan
2:47:02
it looks like there's a car there's a space exterior of the building I believe so I was just wondering if maybe we
2:47:07
might need some additional Landscaping there of varying Heights to better screen that since it's going to be exterior from that um that ground floor
2:47:17
uh brick kind of separation to the parking right
2:47:23
um parking standards I think similar question or similar comments from from
2:47:29
the past uh few letters in terms of if we get a better understanding of I think
2:47:35
we know there's two offices using this parking facility now if we could get a better understanding of the current utilization of the parking um I think
2:47:43
that would help the planning board consider the I there is no parking minimum um and only only four spaces are
2:47:49
being proposed so I think that would understanding how the current users are using that parking facility would
2:47:55
help and then um just additional detail on the elevations in terms of um
2:48:01
material call outs uh and dimensions great thank you
2:48:08
John um as Natalie was discussing landscaping and talking about having U
2:48:14
some taller Landscaping in that one area outside the parking area I know you we also using that area for snow storage so
2:48:20
that's probably going to impact your snow storage area um in that area so
2:48:26
you're going to have to take a look at what you're doing for snow storage on the site um as far as there are some notes
2:48:33
on the plan with regards to snow storage I'd like them carry it over on to some of the other
2:48:38
sheets um in the index it list sheet seven is Landscape and Lighting plan but I haven't seen a lighting plan for this
2:48:45
not exactly sure if you have any exterior lighting going on to this Rea anywhere yeah I
2:48:51
mean there there would be you know sort of like the house lights um are you going to have any Lighting in the parking area that might Shine Down and
2:48:58
Out or more likely you know because it's covered so it would be kind of
2:49:06
like just but but you know we can add that to it okay
2:49:14
um also you have to show the required signage for the accessible parking areas the plan should include all required
2:49:22
signage um I'm asking for the shut off foul for the water
2:49:27
service line uh in the rear of the building to be relocated out of that landscaped area uh especially if you're
2:49:34
going to use that for snow storage in the winter time something goes wrong um just move that into the sidewalk so it's
2:49:40
easily found and accessible um some of the details need
2:49:46
to be cleaned up the tree planting detail it talk talks about uh proposed trees to be
2:49:52
Arbor I don't know if that's just a leftover note from somewhere else or
2:49:57
yeah yeah okay so if we could just adjust that and then just adjusting uh the monolithic curb and sidewalk detail
2:50:04
with regards the cross slope on that that's all I have at this point great thank you John I just had a a
2:50:11
question to Natalie yes I mean I know that parking is always an important
2:50:17
aspect um I'm just wondering you know when bringing up the exterior parking space
2:50:23
and balancing that with landscaping and potentially snow storage does that rise
2:50:28
to the level where it would make sense to consider you know three spaces instead of four or
2:50:35
do we try to make the four work well I get I mean is there a way to fit all
2:50:40
four underneath the building as is shown in the rendering not not with no not with the
2:50:48
amount kind of unless we bring that building you know forward I'm a little baffled though cuz it it it just doesn't
2:50:55
look like from the rendering that you could actually fit a car
2:51:00
there so I mean I obviously I've not what natal's mentioning about the plan
2:51:06
indicating a a lot at least one parking spot there but it just the front
2:51:11
building it just doesn't look feasible by what you're showing here yeah I mean
2:51:17
I I think that's another rendering adjustment just from your rendering ARA
2:51:22
the rear building almost looks to be in line with the front building it does where on the site plan there is quite a
2:51:30
deviation from the sidelines I I'll review that and yeah see if that's what's going on
2:51:36
there yeah um so just as far as the adjustments to this is quite a
2:51:43
significant adjustment to the rear building um and it's it's in my view a
2:51:48
Al headed in the fine Direction I'm still just a little concerned about the
2:51:53
scale relative to the neighboring build you know the yeah it goes from this
2:51:58
three-story building with what appears to be an extremely high first story just
2:52:04
curious why it needs to be that high it almost looks like it's about a 15 ft
2:52:10
yeah I mean that that's that's based on lining up with where the you know where the second floor is on the existing
2:52:16
building because we're we're also you know if you look at the Main Street side we're
2:52:21
trying to bring that that you know that line across as well but what what I
2:52:28
could do is see if there's a way to like drop it at a certain point in the in the
2:52:33
corridor I think it would it would help in two ways it would help this just overall Mass relative to the single
2:52:40
story home right next to it and it would it would sort of help this sort of
2:52:46
awkward proportion of these stilts again the stilt effect is much better um but
2:52:53
you still have that kind of you know flood zone kind of construction quality to these large
2:53:00
pillars yeah I think I mean if you look at the at the plan there on the second floor the the center plan I have it up
2:53:07
on the screen now I mean I I could probably negotiate you know where that staircas is a level change yeah just
2:53:15
just drop it at that point yeah I I would look at it again I think would it would just sort of help you aesthetically and proportionally overall
2:53:22
right um so yeah thanks for considering that I'm curious the the Landscaping
2:53:27
along the existing telephone building uh on that side street that
2:53:33
that's concrete right up to the building right now so the applicant is proposing chopping that away yeah if if if if it
2:53:39
helps with you know getting the full amount of Landscaping on the site and very a very nice touch yeah so um I I
2:53:49
hope uh obviously you're doing it for a reason but it's also it has a a very nice um ultimate effect so I hope that
2:53:56
um that's not just a glossy to get us to like this is that necessary to me I I've
2:54:03
it's hard to see proportionally but the 10 there's a 10% of the site is required to be landscaped right and these are has
2:54:11
that calculation been done in terms of area is that maybe why that's like needed there to needed to get the 10% to
2:54:17
get the 10% okay okay um again you know I understand
2:54:23
the the applicant's desire to maintain a two story building here
2:54:29
um and I can I can I can understand somewhat the rationale of changing the
2:54:35
brick color um so we can I do have uh an option just in
2:54:43
case yeah I I was sort of imagining to myself what it would what it would to match I I I'm more partial to a change
2:54:51
up yeah um whether it's this or not maybe we can discuss a little bit more
2:54:57
but I'm still baffled by this quite honestly this corner condition that massive yeah and and I understand
2:55:04
potentially maybe this is your intention or not but it looks to me to be that you're trying to make a nod to this old
2:55:10
cornice yeah it's sort of like it's being pulled away but um it I mean could simpi it's just so awkward um it
2:55:19
I mean I get it but you're moving from historic to you know somewhat modern right
2:55:27
especially in the proportion of the windows and that connector element
2:55:32
between the buildings personally I would just move away from trying
2:55:38
to get tricky with that and just keep it super simple I think the the subtlety of
2:55:45
the the nods you've made to the existing building especially just
2:55:51
as it relates to you know how the proportions work on the first story and make their way across and same here to
2:55:59
me that's enough um and also if you're going to do
2:56:04
this I appreciate it I would also reflect it here because then you know
2:56:10
you have that continuous water table oh isn't that on that image
2:56:16
there's a stone base on there that not not on this
2:56:21
centerpiece the narrow count right yeah I would just continue it along
2:56:28
um but otherwise what other comments do you guys have
2:56:35
board I don't think the two stories on Main Street is going to work I'm just going to tell you I don't think I'm ever
2:56:41
going to be satisfied with I think that it's always going to be awkward it's going to uh uh obscure the most
2:56:50
prominent same with what I discussed before the most prominent iconic part of this building which is one of the
2:56:57
strongest architectural pieces on Main Street including the Howland Center and
2:57:03
uh um firehouses it's in that uh group of
2:57:08
iconic spaces and uh I'm not confident that whatever interventions you're doing
2:57:13
are going to be compatible or in any way complimentary to the existing fabric of
2:57:18
that building and I think the only way to do is to minimize the amount of visual uh impact you have by just having
2:57:25
that portion be one story um I think that you have multiple
2:57:31
other um techniques to gain additional area or
2:57:38
other things on the site that you haven't explored uh I don't think it's necessarily you've you've uh used all
2:57:44
your options in order to gain value for your client and and also I don't think it's necessarily we don't have to uh
2:57:52
make sure that you get the most amount of units on here I think one of the things that we have a responsibility to do is to uh uh protect the historic
2:58:00
fabric of Main Street which is incredibly important to so many people
2:58:07
in this town so I'm just going to yeah no I I understand and and I did discuss
2:58:13
it with him and and um you know I mean he he he reduced the
2:58:19
number of units by you know 25% and and I mean also you know just in the
2:58:25
discussion it was like you know you don't stand there and look at the
2:58:31
corners from one location all the time you know you're you're it is a three-dimensional building you're walking around it th this reduction in
2:58:39
height W you know without cutting into the corners at all you know does allow
2:58:44
you as you're you know moving through the space and looking at you know that that I'm I'm just letting you know what
2:58:50
his take on it was and why he wanted to you know stay with this reduction rather than reducing it
2:58:58
further I yeah I very much appreciate the reduction to preserve the Cornus I think that was
2:59:03
essential um and I appreciate what John has pointed out in terms of the gestures
2:59:08
that you're making to the existing building elements and trying to use the glass to separate the new addition from the building but you know it's it's
2:59:16
interesting being on the board for years and hearing you know public comments
2:59:21
about various projects and new developments and and people making comments about such and such a project
2:59:26
would sort of you know denigrate the character of Beacon this is one one the
2:59:31
first application I've seen where it's like if this was built exactly as it's rendered I would be kind of crushed
2:59:38
every time I saw this I just I would like to see some other options maybe some different approaches where I could
2:59:45
maybe you know try to get comfortable with it but but the things that that um
2:59:50
that bother me about it looking at the rendering um the the corner closest to
2:59:56
the to the gar to the car wash just seems really bulky uh compared to the
3:00:01
rest of it and also it it's probably just the perspective of the rendering but it it looks like as you go to the
3:00:07
West that the the facade is almost stepping up higher in a sort of
3:00:13
unresolved you know line that doesn't never come back down again it's like a piece of music that crescendos and never
3:00:19
never comes around again but yeah I just this one is is one that um I feel like
3:00:26
um if there's a workable Solution that's not going to that's going to complement the building and not degrade it um then
3:00:32
I'll know it when I see it but this one is not it and I would I would be very I
3:00:38
would have real difficulty in supporting this this particular design
3:00:46
proposal anyone else um I also I I on the facade I would
3:00:54
agree that the uh the imbalance between the very light um portion to the left
3:01:00
where the glass is and it meets the existing building I appreciate um and it
3:01:06
just feels very heavy on the right corner of the of the front facade um in
3:01:12
terms of the brick color I think the um the existing brick has a a very um
3:01:19
unusual color pattern so I think matching it is going to be very
3:01:25
challenging and the existing building is much redder in reality than is showing
3:01:30
on your rendering so um you know using the rendering as a as a visual aid to
3:01:38
help with like selecting the new materials it's um misle it's misleading
3:01:45
at this point and then the the um the
3:01:50
rendering of the landscape doesn't reflect what's on the landscape
3:01:56
plan and on the landscape plan there's uh a few there's a plant that is called
3:02:02
out but is uh on the plan with a code but is not in the plant
3:02:13
list in in the table in the table right can't get anything past this
3:02:21
board thank you and then is there a minimum width for parking
3:02:26
spot 9 ft 9 ft I think cuz the the one that's outside the covering is 8
3:02:34
ft yeah the we were looking at if there was a way to
3:02:40
adjust that or if we call that a compact car you can you can do 8ot for compact
3:02:47
okay
3:02:53
what else I'll I'll I'll look you know I I'll look at those comments again um get
3:03:00
those things adjusted so we can at least get you know on on the same page with that um y I'll I'll again you know
3:03:09
review the concerns with the applicant but and I think he's sort of wanting to
3:03:14
go with this scheme um but but but I also um you know mentioning that again about the
3:03:20
height of the rear portion you know I think I can actually in that stair area
3:03:25
and they don't have to line up necessarily on both sides of that stair
3:03:31
so um I think I think we can adjust that pretty significantly yeah no I appreciate you taking a look at that
3:03:37
yeah U along with the other elements we discussed yeah um great thanks um you
3:03:43
ready for public hearing next month yep any thoughts on hearing from the public
3:03:50
next month board sure thing all right motion to um notice public hearing for next month
3:03:57
motion motion by Lynn second second by Kevin all in favor I I Sor I did Kevin
3:04:07
Kevin great anything else uh no okay the stand
3:04:14
here though oh are you next aren't there any other architects
3:04:23
in okay so this is item number four uh review of applications for amended
3:04:29
special use permit and amended site plan hotel and restaurant 1113 Walcott Avenue
3:04:36
submitted by prophecy theater okay um so so basically the
3:04:41
applicant has a new reduced um scope of
3:04:46
work for the hotel project it was originally 30 rooms and then we changed
3:04:53
it to restaurant instead of the you know the conference event place um so
3:04:59
now the restaurant is still part of the application but the hotel is now 16
3:05:06
rooms um with a reduced footprint and additional parking because of the
3:05:13
reduction in the footprint so we have 39 spaces now um 16
3:05:19
rooms we're we're still within the um that range of 25 to 52 required spaces
3:05:27
you know based on the new parking regulations um you know so so we need to also you
3:05:36
know discuss that and how you how the board wants to um you know look at the
3:05:42
parking there but but we do have additional spaces and um you know so so basically we just
3:05:47
wanted to introduce that before we changed everything else um to correspond
3:05:53
with that yeah so thank you um just to summarize um from where we last left off
3:06:01
one applicant is reducing the size of the hotel obviously and therefore the
3:06:06
number of rooms um basically constraining the the
3:06:12
hotel to the footprint of the existing building there's still an addition
3:06:18
but it it's a lot smaller oh okay I didn't pick up on that
3:06:23
so obviously much much less of an addition right so therefore giving your giving yourself more room on the site
3:06:30
for parking that makes sense and then um am I am I right in in interpreting
3:06:38
this or in my observation that the church
3:06:43
building is for um restaurant use 150 people yeah that that portion of the
3:06:51
application hasn't changed it's really the um the hotel
3:06:56
size okay and then still occasionally events
3:07:01
or no just I mean if there's some kind of
3:07:07
like you know wedding or something at the restaurant you know but but it wouldn't be used for you know
3:07:15
conferences or music events or things like like that so weding like reception kind of thing yeah like like you know
3:07:21
like any restaurant might do retirement party yeah mhm you looking forward to
3:07:26
retiring it's never happen uh okay thanks for thanks for summarizing that okay the the
3:07:33
applicant's here too he just wanted to make a couple notes so
3:07:40
okay um I'm my name is Gavin Hecker I'm one of the partners on this project and uh I'm just you know Arya gave you the
3:07:47
main updates here that um you know we're we're reducing the hotel size um which
3:07:55
reduces our parking need and um just to speak to that we have we're
3:08:01
providing 39 spaces and there's still 250 parking spaces um that are available
3:08:07
within 2,000 ft of the project um and
3:08:12
basically everything else is the same but I'm here to answer any questions that the board might have we've had some
3:08:20
um the Consultants have um I think we received a couple of comments in the
3:08:26
past couple of days and um we'll submit those in writing sorry I'm switching glasses here because I
3:08:34
have all right um yeah so we'll submit
3:08:39
our answers to the consultants in writing as well as I can answer whatever questions you might have right now sure
3:08:45
yeah thanks um so yeah we'll go around on the table again um I don't imagine on
3:08:50
parking or traffic you have anything or you might so but
3:08:57
yeah uh I believe there was an updated traffic management plan submitted but I
3:09:03
don't know that it called out the parking demand under the new scenario so I'm I'm looking back at the previous
3:09:11
submission and the shared parking analysis and in that it had said the restaurant uh was going to have a peak
3:09:17
demand of 70 spaces and the hotel at 30 rooms was going to be 26 spaces so the
3:09:23
30 rooms will come down yeah with the redu uh we called out the the approximate Peak need at approximately
3:09:30
75 now that was that was in the uh submission in the new one okay um and
3:09:36
you've increased your parking capacity on site up to 39 from like 32 to 39 or
3:09:44
so 39 correct um so there'll still be uh a demand that will have to be
3:09:51
accommodated off site yeah Peak Peak demand there is a uh it's approximately
3:09:57
36 spaces okay um and I think the analysis that also noted
3:10:04
um proximity to the Firehouse Municipal parking lot City Hall uh parking lot and
3:10:13
then some others which I don't think would necessarily be used like the train station that's kind of to get up to the site it would be mainly
3:10:20
the uh auxiliary lot would be the Tomkins Firehouse which um we we had
3:10:26
another count and that comes in at 53 spaces instead of 52 But to answer um
3:10:32
John's question the there are eight reserved for um the firehouse
3:10:38
so um with the math there brings us 30 or sorry 53 minus 8
3:10:47
quick what is it 538 4
3:10:54
45 uh in general I think this the site lays out pretty well you'll need some signing you know to help direct people
3:11:02
when they're coming out of the parking lot to know to go around the back side of the hotel you know to exit uh they
3:11:07
can't go straight out uh the oneway you know driveway in uh they'll probably have to be some accommodation you had
3:11:12
mentioned uh the potential for using you know courtesy shuttles for or you know a
3:11:18
wedding reception or a larger party where they can't uh be accommodated on
3:11:24
site um that bus vehicle will just need some probably help maneuvering around uh
3:11:31
you know internal um to the project and the the other couple of lots
3:11:37
I think for the offsite parking are like a two-minute walk so I think it's pretty reasonable thank you yeah thank you um
3:11:45
just real quick I'm just reading your narrative and I'm confused which is not a hard thing to do
3:11:51
um it sort of just States this is relative to the the hours and I'm I'm just maybe not reading
3:11:59
this right the it says the dining facility can operate Sunday to Thursday
3:12:04
700 a.m. to 900 p.m. and Friday Saturday 7:00 a.m. to
3:12:10
10:30 p.m. but then it also says probable business hours for the restaurant are
3:12:16
likely to be and then you go and list different times so is there a distinction
3:12:22
between dining facility and restaurant and why the difference listed here in
3:12:27
the hours um yes there is there's a difference one is the potential hours
3:12:35
and one is the probable hours and that's that's based on um a a restaurant
3:12:42
operator um which we are currently in the process of finalizing so we we do
3:12:49
not we do not have specific hours but the hours that were suggested as
3:12:54
probable business hours are the latter and the 7:00 a.m. to 10:30 p.m. Friday
3:13:02
Saturday is what is requested okay I'm still
3:13:10
confused so what's the difference between the dining facility and the restaurant
3:13:17
uh there is there's not a difference okay so they're both the place you go to
3:13:24
eat right and then so where it says the dining facility which is the same as the
3:13:30
restaurant can operate Sunday to Thursday 7 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. for
3:13:38
example that is is it that you're asking for flexibility to have the 7:00 a.m. to
3:13:45
99 and 7:00 a.m. to 10:30 as hours our operation but once you have a restaurant
3:13:52
operator secured the more likely hours of operation are going to be the more
3:13:57
condensed hours is that that's what's implied here because because we we are we do not have that as concrete data
3:14:05
right now right so basic they're asking for flexibility to have approval for The
3:14:11
Wider hours of operation so but in reality once the
3:14:18
restaurant operator is identified and secured and they've got actual hours got
3:14:23
it so what you're saying is yeah so you you you can operate well that can
3:14:31
is a sort of relative term but you could operate Thursday 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m.
3:14:37
right but more than likely
3:14:42
probably um you're going to operate Wednesday to Thursday 400 p.m. to 10:
3:14:48
p.m. exactly so what that does for us though is if they're asking for approval to
3:14:55
operate for the fulltime period we just look at the fulltime period so yeah so what we would like to understand
3:15:02
is yeah the window that you're going to
3:15:07
ultimately hopefully we can narrow this um operate okay we're just giving you
3:15:16
what reality might actually look like as opposed to the flexibility part of
3:15:21
it now now I understand the distinction but I yeah I think at some point it'd be
3:15:27
it'd be really good to kind of narrow this down and really understand what the actual activity the operating hours will
3:15:34
be yeah I I think also I mean I understand that idea that what's going
3:15:40
to be approved is the wider number if it's going to be approved and and that
3:15:45
that's what shows on the you know on the site plan sheet so it it's sort of locked in there but I think the
3:15:51
narrative was trying to explain the um the potential reality of it which which
3:15:56
may not be as intense okay I understand so what you're saying is right now
3:16:03
you're asking us to consider the the former you're asking us to
3:16:11
consider the window of time Sunday to Thursday 7:00 a.m. to 9
3:16:16
9:00 p.m. and Friday to Friday and Saturday 7:00 a.m. to 10:30 p.m. right correct I
3:16:25
would recommendation that you revise the Sunday to Thursday 7 to9 since the
3:16:31
probable down below is saying Wednesday Thursday operating to 10: because we we
3:16:36
were to approve at 7: to 9 Sunday through Thursday and all of a sudden they're operating beyond that
3:16:42
9:00 yeah yeah there yeah there is that
3:16:47
inconsistency well pointed out I was still trying to get past the whole distinction between the two it's been a
3:16:54
long day or I'm just getting too old for this we'll make that revision as well okay thanks I appreciate that and I
3:17:00
guess the issue is then like when is the peak right like when is it possible that there could be
3:17:07
75 cars at the peak and if that Peak is during business hours for the you know
3:17:15
for City Hall and City H lot is going to be you know relatively full than where
3:17:20
are those cars going to go right so do we know when the peak is and does does my question makes sense Ken from from
3:17:26
your perspective I don't want to drive into your lane yeah I
3:17:34
mean call me Taylor a joke's not even listening Taylor wasn't
3:17:40
paying attention oh man he would have really appreciated that
3:17:45
too say the joke again no it doesn't count please
3:17:51
don't yeah they they did analyze some peaking characteristics you know of it
3:17:57
um you know the hotel is obviously you know in the evening overnight uh for the
3:18:03
restaurant uh there's you know a blip I'll say you know midday at lunchtime of
3:18:08
an average condition that might be different based on the operator of this specific
3:18:13
restaurant um and then peing in the evening uh you know say between 6 7 8 9 you know
3:18:21
o' would be the the peak of the restaurant so uh there could be some overlap if they're busy over there and
3:18:28
we're having a a big meeting here on a on a Tuesday night um but generally if
3:18:34
it's you know Thursday Friday Saturday it's probably not going to have a lot of interaction you know with activities
3:18:40
here at the the town hall okay thank you um Mr
3:18:49
so so looking at the single sheet that was submitted they have some acoustic
3:18:55
remediation measures there although in the resolution there were a number of other acoustic
3:19:03
remediation measures that were to be employed within the um Old Brick
3:19:10
Church um I understand you're going to restaurant but you're also stating you're going to have wedding events and
3:19:15
other similar events there so are we not proposing to do any of the
3:19:22
remediation within the church facility as far as within the windows or anything else now or um there was a a request to
3:19:31
see if we could have open the windows um to allow for fresh air in the restaurant
3:19:36
and um we we went back to our data and found that like we had we have some data
3:19:43
which this will be submitted in writing um for our reasoning but it was um so we
3:19:51
had a sound report from the beacon AV lab that tested a 95 DBA inside the
3:19:57
church as it is now and and then it in a scenar in that scenario there was a 49
3:20:03
DBA on the south property line recorded and a 48 DBA on the North side recorded
3:20:09
with the Sound Ordinance being 55 DBA as it currently is there was not an issue
3:20:15
with the sound at a DBA of 95 which is a the range of a a live rock concert um
3:20:24
that's all the information that I have currently to to explain why we might
3:20:30
want to um not have that mitigation on the windows but that's something that's
3:20:35
up for discussion I'm looking at it you have a wedding event going on and you have a DJ in there or whatever else you
3:20:43
know it's kind of goes back to having the Bands or anything else there you've got music coming out of this place and
3:20:50
you've got residents right next door that was one of their biggest concerns previously my recollection was that the
3:20:56
previous presentation on this project or the most recent one that we were told
3:21:01
that all the acoustic mitigation was going to stay in place it can stay in place if if there's
3:21:07
if there's a we can go back to mediating the
3:21:13
windows but that that's what was presented last time am I correct I think
3:21:19
yeah that's I remember hearing the same um especially now that you want to open the windows what if an event's going on
3:21:25
and somebody's opening Windows you know I think cuz we went through the I know that we had the we'd have to go back and
3:21:31
look at the transcript from the discussion between the the uh sound Specialists but the we were up against
3:21:39
the you know the beacon code that you know with windows closed you you're not to hear any sound after 900 p.m. in side
3:21:47
which was I remember but they were also putting special actical panels in the window driver for it right I mean it was
3:21:53
like it was it's a very Beacon has a very stringent noise ordinance for what you can hear inside a residence with
3:21:58
your windows closed after 9:00 p.m. it's like we talked about the fact that it was like a whisper you know with it with
3:22:05
the way the the code is written so it's pretty stringent
3:22:10
so um also the previous resolution approval included conditions for a
3:22:15
cemetery rest restoration now I see there's no notes on the this sheet at all with regards to cemetery restoration
3:22:21
anymore are we not doing that that's still the same in place so that is the
3:22:27
same so you're still going to do Cemetery so then we need to add the notes back on I think that's on a is
3:22:32
that it's on a different sheet right that yeah I think um that was on that full sight plan remember we had the full
3:22:38
sight plan that included this I'm just looking all I've got is the one sheet so now that that'll all come come up in the
3:22:45
full um Mission okay but but yeah basically this was just sort of to introduce that smaller scale just to
3:22:52
show you what we were up to and then catch up okay um although you're changing the use of
3:22:59
the church you know I still would recommend that uh we keep the post
3:23:05
monitoring of the traffic and parking management that still be left in place and they're still required to do
3:23:11
that um the full plan set shall be rised to reflect the proposed site plan as
3:23:16
currently presented all utilities grading all changes have to be done and shown on the full set um the drainage
3:23:25
analysis is now going to need to be updated along with the stormw facility that's underneath the parking
3:23:32
lot um and then just some other cleanup comments so that's what I have great
3:23:40
thanks you're welcome Miss Quinn yep I can be quick uh my comments are pretty limited I think looking at this from
3:23:46
from a planning perspective this is a reduction in in intensity of kind of of
3:23:52
the use on the site from what was previously approved both I think because of the addition shrinking down um and
3:23:59
and you know additional parking being added um and no changes I believe to to
3:24:05
the proposed Landscaping those aspects so my comments are pretty limited I think echoing some of John's comments um
3:24:12
we are just seeing one sheet though so I think the complete site plan set so we can see all those notes ensure
3:24:17
everything's retained is helpful um updated Seeker eaf required
3:24:24
um I and then I guess parking has already been addressed I think just some of that as the board is moving towards
3:24:31
with the new parking requirements looking more at like firsthand collected primary data if it was mentioned that
3:24:36
there was observations of the parking of the municipal parking lots and parking there so if that could be provided I
3:24:42
think that would be helpful to add to the record and then my point two um should
3:24:48
be stricken I think after a conversation with Jennifer this afternoon there was a
3:24:53
determination previously it was the one about the accessory restaurant the accessory restaurant so I believe there
3:25:01
was a determination that I just don't have that document um previously that
3:25:06
the accessory the restaurant was deemed accessory and so the primary regulations
3:25:12
didn't apply so two can be removed oh I was going to ask you about that
3:25:19
yeah that that's sorry that's me jumping in and not having I didn't have the original uh zoning determination on that
3:25:26
okay thank you Natalie m board anything to add or I have a question on the
3:25:33
parking layout um it seems that in the back um on the in the back row of
3:25:39
parking if it's all full and you're pulling in then you have to back all the way out in order to get out and it might
3:25:48
um help circulation to make a pass through to continue out the
3:25:56
driveway understanding that you lose a couple of spots doing that but yeah it was suggested I think in the
3:26:04
uh by your traffic consultant that we have a sign that when the lot's full so that that's known ahead of time
3:26:11
someone's going to be out there checking the parking lot like you're going to have a person just check
3:26:17
parking if if there's a lot that's going to fill up we can we can provide for a
3:26:23
sign when it fills up in the management plan so that means that's like a flux
3:26:30
like you know people are coming and going in a restaurant it's not like you're there for 3 hours for uh an event
3:26:37
so you're going to have a parking person on staff to put up signs when it's full
3:26:46
uh I'm I'm I can't answer that question at the moment but we'll uh if you want a
3:26:52
a um a better explanation we'll work on it yeah I I would look at it because
3:26:57
Karen makes a really good point because you you pull in and even if you don't go down that
3:27:05
aisle um and you can observe it's full uh the the the ability to turn back
3:27:12
around and then make your way back out to find parking elsewhere is is
3:27:19
constricted right so so there's that that point that Karen made very well
3:27:26
that if you do go down that aisle there's there's really no way out you got to back out and then even if you
3:27:33
don't you know you're you're you're ended up up here and it's not really clear how you're going to it's a
3:27:38
basically a four-point turn to get back out here so I would just put some real thinking to how people are going to
3:27:44
navigate should the parking lot be fall I lose those last two
3:27:50
stalls yeah okay anything else
3:27:58
Bard yeah I recall that the the original contention one of the original contentions about this project was that
3:28:05
it was um that it was a hotel with an accessory use right the hotel was a
3:28:12
permitted use and there was an accessory use that was uh uh you convention space
3:28:19
that was uh uh part of the uh Hotel use and I just wanted to see if we're
3:28:25
tracking how that changed and how that um what that process was from the uh
3:28:33
original um uh uh approvals or the process that
3:28:38
went we went through on this so I think having a little Clarity
3:28:44
on that because it's a pretty sign ific change I don't I'm not necessarily saying
3:28:50
it's uh not a improved use or an improved plan or anything like that but
3:28:56
I think that uh I'd like to understand a little better how the
3:29:02
um U uh what the compliance path is here I'm not sure I understand yeah I'm
3:29:09
was going to say what is the question originally this was it was approved as a hotel with a conference center right
3:29:15
they were the process of satisfying the conditions of that approval right and then decided we're not going to do the
3:29:21
conference center we're going to come and just do a restaurant is the approv use yes it is okay so they're here to
3:29:29
seek an amended approval yeah thank you anything else it's as of right I
3:29:37
guess what else can we do for you within the special think we're good we assuming
3:29:42
you're generally okay with this scenario we we'll develop the rest of the drawings and do a full
3:29:49
submission yes you've heard all of our feedback this evening y thank you thank you as well as obviously our exemplary
3:29:57
Consultants great all right uh let's move on to the next item
3:30:03
on the agenda uh that's item number five uh review of application for amended site plan approval addition to existing
3:30:10
funeral home to bakman Street submitted by crossix LLC
3:30:16
oh H jeez just get another hat or something
3:30:22
maybe change it up a little okay so we we have we want we wanted to know
3:30:30
that if um it's not possible to open up a public hearing next month um we don't have a design on the
3:30:37
hot yes we have everything let's get because Yeah by by your own sort of
3:30:44
statement here it's a little early cuz we haven't received a full complete kind of set of material relative to the full
3:30:52
application so we're going to hold that over until next month
3:31:02
thanks okay so uh so so this property is the Hali funeral home at two beakman
3:31:09
Street the project was um originally approved by the board in
3:31:14
2017 um so [Music] so this is just a small amendment to
3:31:19
that original approval the owner is proposing to add a small addition to the back of the existing building to create
3:31:25
a meeting room for clients um and and how how we got here was um the applicant
3:31:33
originally spoke to um the building inspector uh Bruce who is who
3:31:40
yeah the former building inspector not late um so first he thought that they
3:31:47
could do it and correct me if I'm wrong I'm sure he filled you in but um he
3:31:53
thought he could do it just as a simple building permit and then after looking at it a little bit
3:31:58
further he determined that it the site plan should be amended to reflect this little addition on there just so
3:32:05
everything is up to date with you know because there was an approved site plan already but he he suggested that all we
3:32:12
really needs to do is show that you know where that addition is on the site plan nothing else changes um
3:32:22
you know he suggested that we didn't even need a um you know elevation of it
3:32:28
you know but it it's it's more like submitting it and getting it you know amended for the
3:32:34
record and so so we just have the site plan drawing there's this little floor plan to show you where it is uh it's a
3:32:41
12T X 18t addition in the rear of the building and not kind of there's no
3:32:47
other change to the uh you know the use or the parking or anything like
3:32:53
that Corey I got a question do you have your
3:32:58
[Music] microphone how do you know great did did
3:33:05
in fact Bruce fill you in on this I'm so curious as to why this wasn't just a straightforward per application we
3:33:11
didn't have an in-depth conversation about it but I can understand the validity of what he's trying to say especially with commercial properties
3:33:17
and site plans sometimes they go a long period of time without updating and if there's been conversations in between like you
3:33:24
said it was here 2017 to mitigate any kind of confusion amongst anybody within the community or
3:33:30
the board just to update it so everything's just clear got it concise
3:33:35
no questions that sounds like the spirit of what he was trying to do and say in that um and I would agree with him yeah
3:33:42
okay great no thank you appreciate that um
3:33:49
okay start with you Miss Quinn comment I no comments on this application I'm going to imagine you don't either no
3:33:55
comments wow see that's why I'm wondering why was it so bad um trying to
3:34:01
do the right thing I have one question I did you have to present uh
3:34:07
elevations of that building in 2017 I think we had some rendering but
3:34:14
not of the rear i' I've commented a lot to other friends of mine about the appearance of that
3:34:20
building so I'm just going to leave that for what it's
3:34:25
worth yeah I mean for all sense and purposes you're not going to see this so
3:34:32
the appearance the appearance is the appearance it's no change what do you mean the person I'm not I'm not dis the
3:34:37
actual client doesn't ever get to see the building is that what you're saying well this we going to have my retirement
3:34:43
party wow t i oh my god oh boy um I bet you Taylor
3:34:51
really wanted that [Music]
3:34:59
one so I'm just trying to figure out what we can do I mean we could notice public hearing anything
3:35:05
else we could authorize draft yeah let's do both so let's um let's let's accept a
3:35:12
motion or make a motion or something to that effect to notice public hearing motion and notice public hearing have a
3:35:19
second second by Karen all in favor I I and then um we will then also discuss or
3:35:25
otherwise move to um authorize uh Jen's office to uh uh
3:35:31
draft resolution motion to draft a resolution motion by Len second second
3:35:38
by Kevin all in favor I I anything else thank you great
3:35:48
okay so next item on the agenda this is review of applications of site plan approval and special use permit hotel
3:35:55
and restaurant 1064 Walcott Avenue submitted by a bunch of
