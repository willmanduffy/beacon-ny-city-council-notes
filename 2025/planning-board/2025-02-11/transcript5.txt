3:36:02
letters jmark management okay that's what
3:36:07
[Music] it's good evening I have so many so many options
3:36:14
here but I'm going to go good evening at least it's not the full moon tonight that's tomorrow uh it's a snow moon for those keeping track at home um could
3:36:21
really go for some coffee right now but um for the record Taylor Palmer with the law firm of cudy and fader uh on behalf
3:36:26
of the applicant uh Mark to Fabio who's joining us this evening tonight I'm also joined by our project architect ra
3:36:32
seagull our project engineer Mike bodendorf of Hudson Land Design and our parking consultant Phil gy of cers
3:36:37
engineering and design uh as you mentioned Mr chairman we are before you for this evening for our initial review of a new application
3:36:44
for site plan special Perman approvals proposing to adaptively reuse and connect the two existing buildings uh on
3:36:50
the premises for a proposed hotel and Associated guest men space for an accessory restaurant before I turn it
3:36:57
over to Raa Mike Phil to review the site plans and the traffic analysis that we uh submitted with our application I did
3:37:03
just want to give the board quick background regarding the proposal for the benefit uh of you all and a quick overview of what the property conditions
3:37:10
are as is more fully detailed in our planning board application submission uh dated January 28th discussed with City
3:37:16
staff in a prese submission meeting back in October of last year uh the applicant proposes to connect the and adaptively
3:37:23
reuse the two existing buildings uh on the premises which are currently uh used as you all know for Rose Hill uh Manor
3:37:29
Day School currently the premises is improved by an existing three-story historic building on the Northern
3:37:35
portion of the property and there are two exist and then an existing two-story building on the southern portion of the property as well as Associated parking
3:37:42
areas car bless you the property uh which for once does not require a lot
3:37:48
merger that's that's a first in a while uh is presently classified in the r141
3:37:53
Family Residence District uh and the city's historic district uh Landmark overlay district and then we have but
3:37:59
property in the rd6 designated uh res uh residence districts uh in the area uh
3:38:05
there are hotel and hotel related accessory uses and structures um uh and restaurants sorry excuse me um we are
3:38:13
proposing uh as far as the hotel and accessory uses and structures uh with a seating capacity of uh not to exceed 50
3:38:20
patrons um or permitted special use in the HDO zoning District uh the property
3:38:25
across the street as was uh conveniently just before us uh on on the agenda is the Riverview Funeral Home by Hali and
3:38:31
the surrounding area includes a mixed use of uh multif family single family residential commercial institutional uh
3:38:38
uses including course the funeral home Dia uh and the shopping center with Sal's pizza and um walk out Wine and
3:38:44
Liquor SW as H&R Block in the dental office um I don't know what that Plaza
3:38:50
is actually called Loopers Loopers Loopers thank you um the premises is located and I wanted to call it sales
3:38:56
but um the premises is located approximately half a mile from the beacon Metro North station um we're proposing again to adapt V use the two
3:39:02
existing buildings to construct a three-story addition linking the two buildings for the hotel uh and the associated guest amenity space uh with a
3:39:09
56 uh seat accessory restaurant re is going to go into that in a moment uh and
3:39:15
this footage is in there usually I'll steal all his talking points but I'll let ARA uh do that squirming tonight
3:39:20
customary accessory uses to the hotel include the dining facilities as well as the recreational facilities and Spa and
3:39:26
Conference Room uh the hotel is going to be open and available 24/7 with 365 uh a
3:39:32
year it's staffed around all those hours that it's open uh the dining facilities which will be situated in a portion of
3:39:38
the historic building will offer breakfast to Hotel guests 7 days a week dinner to Hotel guests uh and members of
3:39:44
the public 7 days a week and brunch service for hotel guests and members of the public on Saturday and Sunday uh
3:39:50
there are specific hour hours of operation uh for those components which we include in the application I will say
3:39:56
them now but we can certainly go through them again um the proposed hours of operation for the restaurant are from
3:40:02
5:00 p.m. to 10: p.m. Monday to Thursday uh as and 5: to 11:00 p.m. on Friday and
3:40:08
11: to 11: on Saturday and 11: to 11: on Sunday so uh the spa will only be open
3:40:14
will be open Hotel guests specifically um Tuesday through Sunday and that's from 10:00 a.m. to 5:00
3:40:21
p.m. I noted it briefly just but to expand upon it uh the workspace reading
3:40:26
room the conference uh space the gym and the spa will be used exclusively for hotel
3:40:33
guests uh The Works Space in the conference room would be used for corporate meetings and cultural educational uh professional programs uh
3:40:39
rented out by Hotel guests there will be no mega Death concerts uh in this facility uh for those uh
3:40:46
previously part of other conversations the restaurant may be rented to Hotel guests or members of the public for small scale events such as wedding
3:40:52
rehearsal dinners baby showers birthday parties but not uh for larger events like
3:40:57
weddings the applicant submitted to traffic and parking uh evaluation which concludes that the project is not
3:41:03
anticipated to have significant adverse impacts on uh the traffic conditions and vicinity of the project uh I will
3:41:09
provide a brief overview but don't want to take all Phil's points on this um as compared and I'll sort of take the the
3:41:15
easy ones but as compared to the existing use of the property which is the Rose H Manor day uh the school uh
3:41:20
daycare facility the project is estimated to result in a decrease in the traffic during the weekday morning and
3:41:26
evening peak hours uh the project proposes 50 parking spaces uh to accommodate the hotel and
3:41:32
the accessory uh restaurant use which is sufficient to meet the needs of the project at most times other than on week
3:41:37
weekend evenings uh the traffic and parking EV uh evaluation also explains that the 50 spaces proposed are within
3:41:45
uh the range required under the new uh city regulations uh finally uh the board is
3:41:50
aware this property is also located in the city's water fund uh revitalization Management Area LW I just
3:41:58
say lwrp so we did submit a consistency statement and a coastal assessment form uh indicating the Project's consistency
3:42:05
uh with the recommendations or policies I believe they're referred to in the lwrp uh we are ultimately seeking an
3:42:10
lwrp determination as well as these site plan special permit approvals uh our submission also dated uh January
3:42:18
28th included details regarding how we satisfy the special permit criteria for the HDL uh and of course this is just
3:42:25
our our first sort of presentation to all to give you a background uh about the project understanding it's been a
3:42:30
busy agenda I will ask ra to briefly give you the real visuals on this and then Phil uh to touch on the uh the
3:42:37
traffic uh evaluation in particular the parking uh on the site
3:42:52
this is the point at which I know I'm officially old my 23 and 21 year old daughters went
3:43:00
to Rose Hill when they were toddlers no no my my my 25-year-old daughter graduated
3:43:06
there graduated she matriculate very nice wow and it's my other emotionally
3:43:13
driven response is boy this is freaking huge but we'll get to that but you're
3:43:19
say that proed were sad for selling all your mega death records when you're really old when you not my garage sailed
3:43:25
your Mega Death not my cup of tea but anyway proceed okay um yes I'm I'm I'm
3:43:31
just going to go through the building plans and elevations um for now and
3:43:37
then and still can take you through the side plan and parking um yeah so so as
3:43:45
mentioned there's the two existing buildings on the site one was uh you
3:43:50
know originally a house in the 19th century the one on the left side of the
3:43:56
plan and then in 2006 um the owner built another
3:44:04
similarly scaled building to accommodate you know the
3:44:09
additional um daycare needs that he had at that point and then now they have a
3:44:15
is to connect those two and change the use to a hotel incorporating you know
3:44:21
both of the existing buildings and then this addition um
3:44:29
and you know so so so basically we're looking at how to connect that how to bring elements of the existing buildings
3:44:37
into the addition and and you know work our way through that uh connection piece
3:44:45
some um images of the building um you know so we have that similar kind of
3:44:51
turret structures breaking up the connection um trying trying to get the
3:44:58
roofs articulated we're we're also looking at um a way to adjust that so so
3:45:04
the addition part actually gets a little bit lower um and and that'll show up on
3:45:10
theion just a little bit how is it like a man that the I'm kind of curious is
3:45:16
that the addition is 2 and a half stories and it's set at a lower elevation than the existing oldest house
3:45:22
but it's as tall or taller than the three story existing I don't understand
3:45:29
is that a a rendering thing or no I mean what what what we're doing
3:45:34
you know we we're we're coming in we're trying to you know navigate the
3:45:40
alignment because the the floor elevations of the existing two buildings
3:45:46
don't align right we we and then we also have to come in at the you know at at the parking lot level for the um hotel
3:45:55
entrance but how is like in the rendering how is that a two and a half story building you're claiming that's
3:46:01
two and a half stories I mean look at the elevations don't look at their under one two three
3:46:09
4 well that that first level is mainly buried
3:46:15
and and then and then the the grade you know slopes up as you go to the back of
3:46:20
the building yeah I think we we we we really have to start to drill into the size of this thing and you know there's
3:46:26
a lot to talk about here so um yeah so keep
3:46:33
going the then we'll uh we'll figure out how
3:46:38
to parse the next uh series of conversations but yeah go ahead okay yeah I mean I that's essentially um
3:46:47
you know everything is hotel rooms except for those amenity spaces and the restaurant um and as Taylor said the
3:46:55
restaurant is open to the public the the rest of it is you know exclusive to the
3:47:01
hotel guests um and you know so so that that's sort of
3:47:07
the the program of the building um and and then what what we're you know
3:47:13
looking at is is how to bridge this two together um and and like I said you know we are looking at how to reduce the
3:47:20
impact of the addition in relation to the building yeah I I know Natalie is going
3:47:26
to share some of her observations about um new structures and relationship
3:47:32
scale-wise and prominence to Historic so but I won't steal your thunder um so
3:47:38
yeah we're going to we're going to need to talk about that um so yeah is there
3:47:43
anything else as far as your presentation you wanted to share with us before we well I mean I mean that that's
3:47:48
sort of the building thing but but I um you know um M Mike is here to talk a
3:47:54
little bit about the site and then Phil and then we can okay review stuff great
3:48:03
thanks uh good evening again Philip gy kers engineering and design so uh we had
3:48:10
done a uh comparison of the traffic estimates and as tail are summarized
3:48:16
during the weekday the uh during peak times there would not be a significant
3:48:21
change in traffic Saturday weekend traffic would be increased what are so
3:48:27
weekday peak times what are those during the weekday morning and afternoon peak
3:48:33
hours pretty much you know 5: to 6:00 in the afternoon and 800 to 9: in the
3:48:38
morning uh so there wouldn't be an increase in traffic in those two time periods on Saturday there would be an
3:48:46
increase of course um the other item was
3:48:51
relative to the parking so we looked at the the range of parking the men to the
3:48:57
max is between 27 and 72 spaces uh however we also looked at the
3:49:04
variation with the two uses there based on the uh it Institute of Transportation
3:49:11
Engineers data and during the week week day uh the 5050 spaces that are proposed
3:49:18
can accommodate the peak however on the weekends Friday Saturday uh there would be a shortfall
3:49:26
based on full occupancy of both the hotel and the restaurant so there'd be a
3:49:33
shortfall of about 10 spaces okay with a peak of around 60 so we would have to
3:49:39
use valet parking or other arrangements for offsite
3:49:45
parking uh which we have been in discussions with the uh funeral
3:49:51
parer so okay that's where we are right
3:49:58
now and Phil that that deficit would occur in the evening according to
3:50:03
analysis it would be like correct 8 9 10:00 it would be later in the evening when the the hotel is at full capacity
3:50:09
in the restaurant is at Peak operation yeah
3:50:19
correct great anything
3:50:25
else good evening Mike bodendorf engineer for the applicant um I'll just quickly go through the the site plan
3:50:33
um so we're we're dealing with an existing parking lot here and an access drive that's a bit too steep for
3:50:41
standard grades uh for those types of uh scenari
3:50:46
so we've graded this site out to make the the parking compliant at no more
3:50:52
than 5% in any direction um and we've lowered the uh entrance grade as well
3:50:59
which has kind of brought the whole site down and required some retaining walls here and there um as far as utilities go
3:51:05
we're uh proposing to use the existing utilities uh to each building and Plum
3:51:12
the new building to those uh utilities there's a 4 in water that
3:51:18
feeds the south building um and a 4in sewer that feeds
3:51:24
the the south building so we will be tying the new building into that 4in water and we'll also do some hydrant
3:51:32
testing on the adjacent road that that water main comes off just to verify that
3:51:37
we can provide the sprinkler capability out of that water line uh the sewer line
3:51:42
will um connect to an existing 6in sewer line that comes out of the North building and the north building will
3:51:48
also continue to use its uh what we believe to be a 1 in water service just
3:51:54
for the the domestic side of that um we understand there's some storm water work to do to come in compliance with the new
3:52:01
permit uh we need to make some adjustments um to the design and so
3:52:06
forth but it's it's a work in progress and we'll we'll work through
3:52:13
that early days right okay lot to lot to dig into here who
3:52:20
wants to start start with Natalie I will start um
3:52:27
yeah I'm just finding that for some reason the package that I had downloaded I don't have all the renderings but I
3:52:33
think my my comments obviously still stand so um starting uh with comment one with the
3:52:41
proposed use um looking at you know just stating again that certain commercial uses are permitted in the H loo
3:52:48
specifically to incentivize the preservation of historic structures um
3:52:53
so among those listed are hotel and hotel related accessory uses um as long as the there is the
3:53:01
structures are Ade adequately screened um there's adequate screening of the new structures from surrounding public view
3:53:07
So based on the images of the site I mean we haven't seen a rendering yet like in context but the photos of the
3:53:14
existing site and the existing Landscaping that appears to the North and South it does look at least in
3:53:19
summer months that you're going to be shielded from either side but I think looking at the site the new construction
3:53:26
is obviously not going to be screened from Walcott right from from the main road there so um I think the board would
3:53:33
need to as was already kind of mentioned discuss that and whether or not the proposed placement and new construction
3:53:38
and the proposed Landscaping are adequately screening that new structure um you know there's also a lot of
3:53:44
language we kind of went through it at the beginning of the session about making sure the historic structure is the most prominent and where possible
3:53:51
kind of setting back any new additions behind the historic structures um and making them kind of secondary so um I
3:53:59
agree with some of the plan boards comment said that right now that connecting piece between the two
3:54:04
existing structures is presenting more prominent so um what can be done there
3:54:09
in terms of the height of that structure um and the design of it I think to make it ceed to the historic building I think
3:54:16
the word you're looking for is massive I'll let I'll let you use those
3:54:22
terms masses things um as those are developed I think
3:54:28
just you know it's noted that the existing buildings will be preserved with minimal changes to the exterior I
3:54:35
think that's a really important part of the application so making sure those aspects are called out on the elevations
3:54:40
terms of what is being uh you know if there's specific features that are being preserved or restored noting that if
3:54:48
there are modifications to the existing structures I think noting those especially the historic structure to the
3:54:53
north noting that specifically um needs to be done on those elevations as they're F further
3:54:58
Divine um defined and I think that can actually help with this conversation about primary and secondary
3:55:05
structures um the applicant has noted there's a variance required for the rear yard
3:55:11
setback 50 ft is required 18.6 ft is is proposed um I think since screening is
3:55:17
be going to become so important for this project um tree removal I think noting
3:55:25
larger existing trees on site um which ones are and you know noting if they are going to be removed noting those in the
3:55:31
demo plan and then if they're going to be retained maybe somehow integrating those into the Landscaping plan so we
3:55:36
can kind of see existing and proposed uh together and how that will be used to screen the
3:55:43
building um lighting plan requires photometric so we can see those uh foot
3:55:48
candles across the site um screening of parking facilities
3:55:54
so in the section on hotels the um the specific regulations for hotels um
3:56:00
within the code 223-14 point2 it does talk about outdoor parking areas and
3:56:06
recreational facilities for hotels shall be screened with fencing Landscaping um and or buildings on all
3:56:12
sides towards adjoining resident Lots so where you're not meeting kind of 100t
3:56:17
setback from one family residential lot uh new buildings or the building should
3:56:23
be suitably screened so my biggest conf concern for that is the kind of the rear
3:56:29
portion of the lot where we're putting new parking MH behind the behind the hotel the proposed hotel and those are
3:56:36
AB budding to those um the backyards of those Residential Properties um facing
3:56:42
Harbor Hill so I know you can't step on their properties and take visuals but I
3:56:47
think some kind of visual assessment of what the screening is going to be back there and what the views at that rear
3:56:52
portion of the site are going to become important here kind of similar conversations that we're having for
3:56:57
beakman um I think Ken will talk about traffic
3:57:03
and parking so I'll leave that one um there was just some information missing from the application forms in terms of
3:57:10
non-residential floor space I I think I ended up finding it in terms of I think it was noted on the site plan in terms
3:57:15
of existing floor area versus proposed that could just it would be easier if that was on the application form for
3:57:21
that comparison and are there two residential structures there's two
3:57:27
residential units currently on site no I thought I saw that in the materials that there was let me
3:57:34
see if I noted where I saw that the eaf form stated two two-bedroom apartments
3:57:40
exist on site so maybe modify that in the EF
3:57:46
call there we we'll clarify on the AF okay perfect um and then I did look at
3:57:52
the materials for the uh Coastal assessment form and the consistency statement um and I I didn't see anything
3:58:00
in that in those assessments that I disagreed with so I think the documents are sufficient for the planning board uh
3:58:05
to declare consistency with lwrp thank you um could you just clarify the the
3:58:11
rear yard setback variants where that comes into play and
3:58:17
and are the exist is the existing original building
3:58:22
existing non-conforming R is going to go show it
3:58:27
on the plan yeah I'm just curious since we were on the subject of variance mhm it's pretty significant the
3:58:35
[Music] variance just try to highlight that on
3:58:40
the
3:58:55
yes it that that green line here is a very very very very very faint
3:59:01
Green Line yeah it it'll get less faint okay so it's going to track to that
3:59:07
v-shaped right uh lot line yeah okay yeah the existing building is is already
3:59:13
non-compliant [Music]
3:59:18
yep a big that's a really big
3:59:24
variance
3:59:32
mhm for another board to consider but also but also yes we the site it is
3:59:39
because of the jog in the property but but we'll be submitting the you know's go through all the five factors and the relation back to keep keep in mind
3:59:46
though that we do send recommendations out to our friends at the zoning board so indeed and we're familiar with the
3:59:52
neighbor too he has some involvement in the city here last name begins with k that's the
3:59:59
one yeah okay thanks Mr Russo um so my
4:00:05
first comment should be stri uh stricken based upon our conversation earlier
4:00:11
today um I'll skip over the ones that now Natalie also spoke about um the
4:00:16
applicant will need to conduct an i Andi study of each of the existing facilities on the site
4:00:22
itself uh separate lighting plan should be submitted with the photometrics uh I would recommend as
4:00:29
this progresses along that this be referred over to the building department and the fire department uh to see if
4:00:35
they have any concerns as far as access or anything else before this goes too far down the road
4:00:41
okay um we had some comments on the engineers water and sore report um one
4:00:48
of them was the report noted 57 seats in the restaurant other documents are
4:00:53
stating 56 seats um on the plans
4:00:59
themselves the initial sheets are showing a bio retention storm water facility and the remainder of the
4:01:06
engineering plans are showing underground stormw infiltration system so the plans need to be coordinated as
4:01:11
to what's actually going to be constructed on on the site here
4:01:19
um the rest of it is just kind of work that they've got to work through there's a lot of engineering stuff that they
4:01:25
have to get through as they go forwards with grading storm
4:01:33
water okay yeah he only touched on a few you're in receip obviously of the full
4:01:40
yes um it's quite a bit here so still some work to do yeah thank presentation
4:01:45
yep appreciate that on traffic I haven't looked through this in detail um but I'll get comments
4:01:52
out to you and a couple of things that had popped out uh was trying to identify where the entryway for the hotel was
4:01:59
there's a single handicap spot near it and there's another one that's kind of hanging out off to the left hand side um
4:02:07
I don't know if that needs to be closer you know to that main entry or not but take a look at that and then uh look
4:02:13
like the trip generation for the daycare was based on it I don't think it was based on actual
4:02:19
counts um there is some Saturday trip generation proposed but the school is
4:02:24
closed I think on Saturday and Sunday so that's you know that's why we're the yeah the increas is cor to the fact that
4:02:31
the use is different and as I'm kind of reading the grading you know if you go
4:02:36
out there and look at the site right now the slope of the driveway goes up and in the future proposed plan that actually
4:02:43
we lowered so that might help affect your comment about why is there so many stories there in the middle and not
4:02:50
being any higher than the the existing structure it's because the ground is getting lower in that
4:02:56
area I'll finish up my comments and I'll submit them thank you okay
4:03:03
um yeah I think just generally you know us there's going to be a lot of time spent um talking about not just the
4:03:11
scale but the aesthetic it's relationship to the existing buildings it's massive um I'm I'm going to be super
4:03:17
curious about how this Mass um is perceived from Walcott
4:03:26
actually um so you know I think sharing with us visuals that actually reflect
4:03:34
the reality of what that Visual and that experience is going to be um I I note
4:03:42
that there is a and I'm I'm assuming I'm hoping you'll confirm there's a large
4:03:49
stand of row of very mature beautiful Evergreens right along Walcott in front
4:03:55
of the newer building I'm I'm hoping against hope that you're not planning on
4:04:00
oh there they are are those the ones I'm and there they remain yeah they're they're going
4:04:06
to remain right yes and we are and you you spoiled it but my Valentine says
4:04:11
that you will have in development uh renderings from Walcott good so yeah and
4:04:18
I think yeah I think you know we we're going to spend some time really working
4:04:24
on this just in terms of the aesthetic and the scale I mean I think can I can I answer something on
4:04:30
that topic just because I I looked through a bunch of reference materials trying to find um existing Victorian
4:04:36
structures that had kind of this you know the sort of scale and the use that
4:04:41
were similar with with the sort of Queen Anne style turret
4:04:46
bearing houses and there's you know there's places like Angel of the sea and Cap May New Jersey that has kind of a
4:04:53
similar Vibe and it's anchored by two wings that are queen an style homes there are other existing Victorian
4:05:00
structures that of the scale and the way that they they maintain the prominence of the turrets and don't subordinate and
4:05:07
diminish those those existing structures is by looking at manard roofs to keep
4:05:13
the the central parts from getting too tall when they have Gable ends the ones I saw were more Gothic style so more
4:05:21
steeply R roof uh angles and makes the
4:05:26
Gable ends a little bit more uh scaled down compared to the
4:05:31
turrets and the and the other details and if you know when we get to airb I
4:05:36
can bring in examples and photos but the but the the way those Gable ends are set
4:05:41
up right now on the new edition looks very disproportionate compared to to anything
4:05:47
I could find you know in the style of the time um and that that stretch from from this
4:05:56
site up to kind of the corner of her Plank and 9d you have this this unique
4:06:03
character of these really kind of stately Queen an homes you know a number of them have turrets and uh definitely
4:06:11
whatever you do here you want to preserve that and not diminish it it's Unique and we don't have you know across
4:06:17
the river in Newberg there's streets and streets of magnificent victorians we don't have as many a
4:06:31
beacon anything else yeah I think the last thing you said touched on one of the important
4:06:37
things about this building in as a part of the fabric of not just Beacon but a
4:06:43
lot of cities of its size in the Northeast uh that date from like the
4:06:48
1870s that whole Victorian period there's a tradition there's a there's a
4:06:53
a a pattern it happens in Red Hook and other places and also in Beacon that the
4:06:58
entrances to these towns would uh have prominent um uh large uh decorative
4:07:07
beautiful houses on the entrances on the main roads because that's that's uh uh
4:07:14
uh that was where people would proudly display their wealth and just their civic uh enthusiasm right so there
4:07:22
number of places at on 9d before you get to the other project we re uh um
4:07:27
previously reviewed there's this whole series of Victorian Painted Ladies right uh when you go down Walcott I think lens
4:07:35
is U across from the church there's another series of uh Victorian houses
4:07:40
which uh are an entrance to the City part of what we were talking about it
4:07:45
makes uh it really nice to visit a place uh and this is another section where
4:07:51
there are a series of uh large prominent Victorian structures that add to the
4:07:58
character right it's not just the um it's it's it's the fact that they're
4:08:04
situated in large Lots they're Standalone they're like sculptures right and they're I don't think anyone would
4:08:11
say that those weren't that wasn't something that was like striking and beautiful about any town that has that
4:08:17
right what you don't what you so that is part of what I think a um
4:08:28
uh the intent of a historic uh District would want to preserve right is that
4:08:34
fabric that um it it that's that this this plan sort of uh violates and I
4:08:41
think that's why there's that immediate reaction against it and I just wanted to say Taylor that I I found it very
4:08:47
helpful that you listed all the requirements of the HDO on your on your
4:08:53
letter because when I go through it I can't find any of them that uh this this
4:09:01
proposal meets either the spirit or the letter of and and I I looked closely it
4:09:08
doesn't deal with the it's um the design character and appropriateness I wouldn't say it this contributes in any way to
4:09:16
that that it it doesn't work in the historic context it's actually the specifics of the design you did talk you
4:09:22
were trying to work with like maybe perhaps we could make this to sort of look a little it's more about the the
4:09:28
immediate thing that everybody's noticed this is just the bulk and mass which part of which is going to be uh as you
4:09:37
um if anyone who drives and looks at the existing Rose Hill building you're going uphill on Walcott and it's a and it's a
4:09:44
very beautiful Victorian building you're looking up at it and when that becomes a uh a massive uh residential or hotel
4:09:53
structure it's going to be even more bulky and imposing uh no matter what the
4:10:00
uh uh uh uh remediation is attempted uh it doesn't work on the historic context
4:10:06
it doesn't um uh it it it anyway none of these I
4:10:12
don't I don't feel like that in any way that it worked within the spirit or the letter of what was um uh required for
4:10:21
this project and there are a number of other um uh setback and bulk and uh other uh
4:10:31
issues that you have that you're going to have to ask for either permission or uh or forgiveness or something like that
4:10:39
and uh I I think that I can't imagine that this is going
4:10:47
to uh get a lot of positive feedback unless it's
4:10:53
severely uh scaled back and brought into uh brought into line with the uh
4:11:00
the spirit and character of that part of Beacon and and I think what would uh commonly be considered the uh uh uh our
4:11:09
community uh Fabric and uh and uh uh
4:11:15
just texture and everything so that's it it I have a it that's
4:11:21
enough I have a quick uh comment about the mass and the structure um I would
4:11:27
question the program need to connect the buildings I've been to many successful
4:11:35
Hotel Spa restaurants where different uses are in different buildings they
4:11:42
don't need to be connected did just consider you know I wasn't
4:11:48
going to add only because it's getting late but I was thinking very much uh the same as relates to how the new
4:11:56
construction relates to the two existing buildings um there is an opportunity to
4:12:03
think about them not necessarily connecting but if there is a necessity for them to connect um that is the sort
4:12:10
of the first point that I would suggest you really start drilling down into um
4:12:15
in addition to just the relative scale uh on the site so but it's a very very
4:12:21
good point Karen so anyway I think that's enough for this evening because
4:12:27
it is getting late um anything else uh I don't think so tonight other
4:12:32
than to ask if the board might consider circulating uh its intent for lead Agency for the environmental review yeah
4:12:38
we can do that so um motion by the board to um authorize circular ation of intent
4:12:44
to act as lead agency motion to circulate intent to act as lead agency motion by Len second second by Kevin all

4:17:54
we're going to make you come back can I ask a quick question that the existing facade is that what is the material
4:18:01
that's on the right now on the on the um the lower part of the the windows no
4:18:08
that the actual brother's facade um stone stone is yeah is Stone
4:18:13
so then is it is the new uh facade going to replace the the stone that's already
4:18:20
there on the bottom or just continue it just an infill right yeah excuse meor whatever is existing is
4:18:27
staying this entire both sides this entire area is being infilled with new right uh it's
4:18:35
basically the existing storefronts which are here are are being replaced right um
4:18:44
so there's he's F he's filling he's doing new signage he's taking the awnings down right right it's mainly
4:18:49
taking the awnings down new L sign and filling in these two zones here so no new stone is being added it's the stone
4:18:57
on the facade is staying the same or I think there's a little detail at the top of those stone columns which is there
4:19:04
now just just the tops of the columns yeah and I can't see what's there right now because of the awning but right yeah
4:19:10
actually looks like there might even be a little capital on on them yeah um so so someone I'm I'm mean
4:19:18
representing the person who did this so I I take full responsibility but not the plane you see it peeking out into the
4:19:24
owning yeah yeah I I'm just trying to cuz it said new facade and I was trying to figure out what you know new or the I
4:19:31
think there was a note saying yeah yeah column caps are are
4:19:36
okay wood but to match the stone yeah I mean generally looks great I it's it'll be interesting without the awnings just
4:19:43
cuz they I'm so used to them being there but and they're putting in those uh Cafe you know bold Windows yeah that's kind
4:19:50
of a neat effect it's the they're kind of following what the hotel is doing are they in love with that that
4:19:56
helvetica the fun yeah I'm just is it helea looks like no is it is it not aial
4:20:03
it's a skinnier just typed it out on the computer they want no do they want
4:20:09
serifs or anything I don't know I just I just thought it looked it says Ariel it is what it is kind of
4:20:15
