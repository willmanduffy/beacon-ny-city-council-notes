0:14
okay it's 7 o'clock we are going to start with our Workshop from 7: until
0:21
7:30 and then begin our regular meeting agenda at 7:30 and so with that thank you Natalie
0:28
looks like you're teed up we're going to spend a little time talking about special use permits what they are how
0:33
they work and I think as well you were going to touch on HD it yeah it comes up in here as one of the special use
0:40
permits with additional regulations great yeah so you know following off you know the first meeting January Jennifer
0:46
went over kind of the board the board's procedures so we're going to try and follow some of the bigger kind of chunks
0:52
of the code to uh remind the board and the public of the of their jur of the board's jurisdiction so special use per
1:00
are just one of the items under the planning board's jurisdiction right you also have site plan subdivision and
1:06
certificates of appropriateness and then special use permits so we'll just go through today
1:12
kind of what is a special use permit we'll talk about special use permit review as it's kind of outlined in the
1:18
city of Beacon's code uh we'll go through the appropriateness of requesting variances from special use
1:25
permit standards and then also kind of final determinations and conditions um
1:30
that can be placed on special use permits uh so what is a special use
1:36
permit um it's a use that is allowed in a district it just is subject to uh
1:43
compliance with certain standards so sometimes uh special uses get confused with variances right so unlike a
1:50
variance which gives a property owner the right uh to use their property in a way that is inconsistent with the code
1:57
uh special uses are consistent with the code they just have additional stipulations kind of placed on them that the board must review um it's kind of
2:05
like another layer if you will it's just another layer right so and we'll go through that when we get into we'll look at the bulk table and kind of talk about
2:12
certain uses that are special permit in one district and not in others and we'll talk about why that may be so actually
2:19
we're there now so we'll talk about that now um so kind of as Jennifer went over
2:24
in the last meeting right that the legislative body the city council sets the code right so they are the ones deciding kind of of what um uses are
2:32
permitted in some districts permitted by special use permits in other or prohibited in others and the planning
2:37
board is responsible for kind of implementing that as the code is written and adopted by the legislative body so
2:44
the first step when you're looking at a use just for folks you know there is um the special you or the use regulations
2:50
are in section 22317 or it's also attachment to of the codes so when you're looking online at
2:56
the zoning code it'll be kind of up at the top as an attachment and you'll get this table and there's two pages of it
3:02
um I know it's a little hard to see let me see if I can kind of zoom in a little bit here uh so what you have on the left
3:09
hand side is a list of all uses or most uses or General Uses and then across the
3:14
top you have each of the zoning districts kind of identified and then so
3:19
uses are categorized uh by use and by District so a use that is permitted in
3:26
one District may be excluded in another um or maybe you know may require a
3:31
special permit um city of Beacon also has as you can see down here special uses are identified by SP um if it's a
3:39
special use that needs to be re reviewed by the planning board and then if there's an aster next to that that is a
3:45
special use that is specifically reviewed by the city council and that just so you know for
3:50
example let's look at parking structures as an accessory use right so that's one that Zoom back out a little bit in the T
3:58
District here uh it is a special use permit but in the the CMS District or
4:04
the linkage District or the Waterfront District it is permitted by right and so why that choice was likely made by the
4:10
legislative body is you know the te district is a little bit more of a kind of mix right it changes in densities
4:16
changes in Heights and structures so it's going to be a little bit more sensitive about whether that structured parking will be appropriate to the
4:22
context of that neighborhood um so that's why it's been designated special use and there's uh regulations that the
4:28
board would look at when reviewing doing that um okay up so we just went over
4:36
kind of the list of uses um that are identified and how you would identify that the approval Authority is the next
4:42
step um Jennifer I'm going to give you credit because I stole your this is your presentation I'm just redoing it uh
4:48
approval Authority the legislative body as I said um the city council here they are the ones vested with the right of of
4:55
uh reviewing special use permits but they can um designate that authority to either the planning board or the zoning
5:02
board of appeals or they can retain that Authority for themselves as they have done for some uses um
5:12
so and for example you know we've been the city of Beacon has been kind of moving through um moving many of the
5:20
special use permits to review by the planning board rather than the city council um one that we kind of talked
5:26
about the last time that is it's been moving uh down in its review is is accessory apartments right so that used
5:31
to be under the authority of the city council solely then it got moved to the planning board and then in the last
5:37
revision to the code a lot of that Authority for those approvals has actually been given to staff um in terms
5:43
of reviewing certain certain special uh certain accessory Apartments so then we'll get into kind
5:49
of procedure when when you say staff you mean building department building department y yep um the specific yeah
5:56
the building inspector zoning enforcement officer um and then so the next step that we'll kind of talk about
6:02
and this is what we'll go through the rest of the presentation is really kind of the procedure right so the zoning code specifies the procedure that must
6:09
be followed and the specific criteria for review so again that is uh code and
6:14
language that is adopted by the city council and then um put before the planning board uh so you know the the
6:21
regulations talk about everything from how many copies of applications are
6:26
needed timeline what the public hearing notification processes um public hearings are
6:32
required for all special uses uh by state law um so obviously again in pyy
6:39
or in uh Beacon they are also required here uh there's timelines in terms of
6:44
after the closing of the public hearing how many days does the planning board have to make decisions that's all outlined in the code um and then also
6:52
kind of the expiration of these permits so if they're issued specifically in the city of Beacon if a special permit is
6:58
issued um it expires within a year if the building if it a building permit is
7:03
not pulled for that and then that applicant would need to come back before the board to get that special permit again so they don't kind of run with the
7:09
property forever um if they're not acted on there are instances where special
7:14
permits uh will need to be renewed correct yes um I I'd have to look at
7:21
each one to see if there's that specific in the code but we'll get to kind of conditions and things that can be placed and so often what you'll see for special
7:28
use permits is um there's an option you know that you can put a timeline you know within two years have this
7:34
information submitted so the board can re-review it um also something very quite unique about the city of Beacon is
7:40
that the building inspector does have the authority to revoke a special use permit if conditions or the stipulations
7:47
in the code are not being met um for example if hours of operation are placed on a use right that you cannot be
7:54
operating past 10: p.m. or that you must have you know some kind of shuttle or something in place
7:59
if it's found that that operation is not occurring uh the special use permit can be re revoked how is that unique to be
8:06
aren't other municipalities that sophisticated I guess not all I you know
8:11
I I I'd have to look through um other communities I work in that's not expressly um stated in the code that
8:17
that can be with that that can be revoked like that um okay so again text is small here
8:26
but you know just so everyone knows this is section 223 18 of the code these are
8:31
the general special use standard so these apply to all all special uses um
8:37
in in any District right and so these uh six kind of regulate some of the larger
8:45
areas I think of uses right looking at the location and size of the use and the hours of hours of operation and
8:51
intensity um looking specifically at where the buildings are placed and walls
8:56
and Landscaping and kind of screening those from adjacent use um there's also looking at making sure
9:03
that the operations are not uh more objectionable uh than other uses
9:09
permitted within that District so that is something kind of helpful if you are looking at a special use permit or
9:14
special use um and there are conversations about impacts in terms of
9:20
you know number of people coming there or traffic it is helpful for the board to kind of look at that in comparison to
9:25
other uses that are permitted in that District right um
9:31
parking areas right there's a specific um there's specific kind of stipulations
9:36
regarding parking areas being of adequate size and not causing unreasonable traffic
9:41
congestion um which is kind of something standard that the board looks at for most uses but is expressly stated for
9:47
special permit uses um obviously accessibility for emergency services and
9:52
making sure proper infrastructure uh to serve that special use and then finally that the special use is en with the
10:00
comprehensive plan and if applicable the local Waterfront revitalization program the
10:06
lwrp so that's the general ones right that apply to everything then there are also specific um specific standards that
10:14
apply to specific uses so in addition it's kind of again another layer right there's that General General
10:19
stipulations and then there's the additional layer of specific standards for specific uses and so Beacon has some
10:26
for bed and breakfast um hotels uh and then we'll get into some on for
10:31
specifically special uses within the historic districts uh but here's just an example one for Ben and breakfast um
10:39
businesses so I won't go through all of these specifically but some of them are
10:44
kind of numerical right looking at the minimum lot size um that you must have or the number of bedrooms the permitted
10:51
number of bedrooms that you can have um and then some of them are a little bit more kind of
10:57
um uh I guess up to the to the review and discussion of the board actually
11:02
that's a good example just maybe go a little bit deeper right for example in certain districts bed and
11:09
breakfasts are allowed under special use right so for example in a potentially
11:16
residential district yes right yep so all the R1 all the Rd and T districts
11:22
bed and breakfast are special permit got it right so again that's uh and then in the Waterfront District there's special
11:27
permit in the Waterfront Park District there special permit reviewed by the council not for bed and breakfast bed
11:33
and breakfast okay interesting so there's interesting yeah different layers of special use different
11:39
districts but same use yeah yeah um yeah and so just to the point
11:47
like some of them are you know some of them are talking about must be this certain size and then some of them are
11:52
more up to the discretion of the board in terms of talking about you know adequate adequate screening from
11:58
adjacent residential uses right right so there's not a set number of what that screening must be or what that Landscaping must look like but the board
12:04
is charged with giving that an extra hard look and evaluating screening from adjacent properties
12:10
there and then one I wanted to talk about specifically is there is a section in the beacon code that you know use is
12:17
permitted by special permit in the HDL um in the historic district Landmark overlay why I wanted to point this out
12:24
specifically too is this isn't necessarily identified in that chart and that table that I had originally kind of
12:30
pointed to these are specific to the overlay District the historic overlay district and it is these uses are
12:36
outlined just in this code so this is one area where if you're just looking at the use table you wouldn't necessarily
12:42
know that these uses are permitted by special permit in this District so it's helpful to um kind of go here to see
12:48
what uses can be in that overlay District um so we'll just kind of go through these you know one grouping of
12:54
uses that is permitted uh by special permit is the is special Iz businesses
13:00
um uh normally associated with kind of History Arts culture uh appropriate to
13:06
the structure and compatible with the neighborhood and some examples here are artist Studios antique shops um very
13:14
specific rare book coin stamp shops or similar types of uses again determined by the planning board so these kind of
13:20
novelty uses are permitted as as a special use um in the historic district
13:26
residential hotel or professional uses provided that they are appropriate to the structure compatible with the
13:32
neighborhood and are located on a road that can accommodate increased traffic as determined by the planning board
13:38
these uses may include they talk about restaurants bed and breakfast come up again uh professional offices multif
13:45
family residential artist live workspaces and hotels and hotel related
13:50
accessory uses and then some of these there's even another layer if you get down but this is kind of just talking about the special uses that I
13:57
permitted and then there's additional standards for this right special permitted special permits are warranted
14:02
only under certain conditions um in the historic district uh so not withstanding
14:08
the limitations kind of that we went through before um in subsection
14:13
B the planning board May approve a special permit for any of the uses that we just kind of went through and may
14:18
allow a larger number of seats employees dwellings or uh live workspaces if they
14:24
determine that a larger number is warranted by certain criteria and those criteria can be building size building
14:31
configuration um nature of the proposed preservation uh historic nature and
14:37
context of the building and then so the purpose of this I just kind of stepping back and trying to think about what
14:42
these regulations are allowing is that historic buildings and historic sites don't come in all one sort of shape and
14:48
size right so what the legislative body is trying to do with these regulations is give guidance and flexibility to the
14:54
code right because the goal here is to preserve historic structures within the city of Beacon and it's not a one- siiz
15:01
fits-all kind of um job right so these are kind of parameters for the board to
15:06
function with it maybe I'm wrong but I interpreted that to mean that what you
15:11
just described in a district and correct me if I'm wrong because I probably am but
15:17
that before a special use permit can be invoked if you will certain base
15:23
conditions need to be met is am I interpreting that right what do you mean in terms before
15:29
they can apply or before you can actually say well I'd like to approach this special use permit you would have
15:36
to be one of the uses listed right and I think there would need to be a zoning determin there need to be a
15:41
determination from the building department kind of categorizing you within one of those uses that are permitted um and then some of them I yes
15:48
some of them some of the direct stipulations in terms of square footage of the site or number of rooms I think
15:55
that would also be caught during the initial review by the building but I think there's this is you know the
16:01
section I just went through in terms of these certain conditions that weren't a larger size these are very much up to
16:07
the this is up to the discretion of the planning board right the planning board May approve a special permit so it would
16:13
the application would still get before you but you would be responsible for going through these criteria that's
16:18
helpful yeah I did interpret it wrong but thank you that's very helpful um and then findings so the planning
16:25
board must make the following findings before so this is now before you can kind of make that actual approval right
16:30
that any exterior restoration shall maintain the architectural and historic Integrity of the structure um any new
16:37
construction shall be compatible with neighboring structures so you're looking at the context of the neighborhood uh
16:42
the proposed use is compatible with the neighborhood and activities permitted within the structure can be adequately buffered from any surrounding
16:49
residential homes resulting traffic generation will not overburden existing roads and adequate parking can be
16:55
provided without unduly destroying the landscape or the setting of the structure and the proposed use is appropriate to
17:01
the structure will Aid in the preservation of the structure and will not result in undue alterations or
17:06
enlargement of the structure um so that's kind of those are just two examples right you have other
17:13
uses within your code that have those those specific parameters um but then I
17:18
just have two more slides that I think we want to wrap up with in terms of variance and waivers uh so it is still
17:24
possible there are these kind of stipulations within the special use um regulations but an applicant can still
17:32
seek um they cannot still seek a variance uh to remove that if it's
17:37
causing a burden on the site right so um where proposed special use say that again you can still seek a variance
17:45
right that you could from relief from these sections of the code so say there's a stipulation special use permit
17:50
that says You must have a 4,000 foot paral in order to have this special use
17:55
oh so so actually back to my original you just you confirmed what I was assuming so there are some Basel yes
18:02
there are some baseline conditions that need to be in place for special use yeah to be considered and so now you're
18:08
talking about sort of a new element to special use variances can be sought yeah
18:13
well it's interesting because it kind of you know I think this is where code gets tricky right so there could be one that is so the stipulation says that
18:22
um say you can only have six bedrooms in a bed and breakfast right but there's a
18:27
specific section of the code that one that we were just looking at section c that allows the vest the planning board
18:33
with the right to go over six units so you would be the first step to to review
18:39
that and the board would review whether or not say they were proposing eight units is appropriate if this board
18:45
deemed that it was not then the applicant could still apply to the zba and seek a variance so that that's
18:52
almost too prog there like interesting I don't think I've ever seen that happen before but that's interesting that someone would come to the planning yeah
18:58
I haven't been here long enough to know another good example A lot of times you'll see like distance requirements in
19:03
the code for a special permit like for gas stations for example you you can't have a gas station within a th000 fet of
19:09
another gas station someone could seek a variance to allow a gas station to be 800 ft from another gas station um and
19:17
that would be an area variance um even though it's a special use permit standard you could still see a VAR
19:24
standard yeah but even this Nuance of you know where somewhat Falls under the
19:29
planning board perview to it would have to be stated in the code that the planning board has that Authority the
19:34
first but then to see an applicant not necessarily agree with that and go to the zoning board That's Unique yeah
19:41
there's very yeah there's usually a release valve for for most yeah regulations in code that's good it makes
19:48
sense that there is but I think for the example that Jennifer gave you know if there's not if it doesn't specifically say in the code the planning board can
19:54
deviate from this distance they can't come to you and make that case they have go to the C make that Cas but there are
20:01
for example in the historic overlay district there are some additional parameters given to the planning board
20:07
in terms of jurisdiction to um be flexible with those numbers yeah you see
20:12
that too not under special permit parameters but um for parking within your code there's a lot of well under
20:19
the new code it's a little different but under the the previous parking code you could issue waivers for parking right
20:26
things were made um so the applicant wouldn't have to automatically go to the zoning board to seek a variance you had
20:31
Authority built in to the code for waivers and it's the same thing here it's just Authority built in to the code
20:37
for you to issue a waiver instead of automatically going to the zoning board that term waiver for some reason came up
20:43
as being one that wasn't necessarily appropriate waiver the planning board issues waivers zoning board issues
20:49
variances yeah essentially they're kind of the same thing when you drill down into it but
20:56
yeah are there limits to our waiver uh perview like what can be waved it
21:02
depends on the circumstance and the code it's all code be it's all written down y
21:09
yeah yeah cool yeah and there's a in general there's been a move I've seen a lot of communities moving from like
21:16
building in ability for waivers into the planning board to give the planning board more flexibility to review a site
21:22
plan rather than always necessarily sending it back to the zba the zoning board because the zoning board has very
21:28
specific specific criteria for what they're looking at in terms of granting variances so is it if it is something
21:34
that the legislative body understands to require more flexibility or something you that they see may be appropriate
21:40
they'll likely give the waiver ability to the planning board instead of instead of requiring a
21:46
variance in your experience on the zba had you ever come across applications where you've thought gee I wish the
21:52
planning board we're looking at this rather than zoning just curious yeah definitely in a
21:58
particular where you have something like you know an area variance with regard to
22:03
some dimensional regulation but it was the whole thing was the whole the whole
22:09
thing was part of a larger site plan approval and the reality is how well this fits in was is something that was a
22:17
lot more in front of the planning board just us um and then I mean as you noted
22:23
it if it's actually being characterized as a variance then and there's a
22:29
relatively specific standard that applies yeah whereas in front of us it
22:36
basically going to be whatever standard city council has put in to cover yeah the the waiver so it's going to I would
22:43
say in Broad Strokes it's going to Signal an increased legislative receptiveness
22:49
to adjustments that are in those categories Tak in place
22:55
mhm um and then just one last slide so um at the at kind of at the end when the
23:01
when the planning board is making a determination with regards to a special use permit uh the board does have the
23:08
authority to impose reasonable conditions and restrictions as long as they are directly related uh and
23:15
incidental to the proposed special use so they do have to have some kind of Nexus um connecting them to the use
23:21
that's being reviewed um and then I sold this case law from Jennifer's last presentation um where the cours decides
23:28
that a condition must be related to the use of the property and not the
23:34
applicant or owner and I think the example um that was in this case was the Wegman's this was the Wegman's case
23:40
where uh the board tried to say that you know the special use is permitted but only if the supermarket is a is a
23:50
Wagman sorry Whole Food the town of gates and the the planning board did
23:55
that or the council Town board the town board yeah and deciding whether or not where that special use could be granted
24:02
or making it a condition so a condition of the special use so you can't you can't make the special use or for you
24:09
know for example say somebody owns a bunch of properties and maybe someone has had some violations or something on
24:15
another property in the city I don't think it would and Jennifer correct me if I'm wrong I don't think it would necessarily be appropriate to add
24:22
conditions to that property owner yeah this this law applies to everybody but Dave Smith yeah exactly and Dave Smith
24:28
we don't trust you so we're going to put like these extra conditions that are related to you as an operator not as the
24:34
as the use itself so you should if there are conditions being placed they should be applied directly to the use and be
24:40
reasonable in terms of regulating that use so that's the intro to special use
24:47
regulations nice thank you yeah very helpful we have a few minutes any questions on
24:53
the subject matter riveting stuff
24:58
it is next month we're going to make U John do Swifts
25:08
yeah yeah was there just new regulations adopted you can walk us through that you really don't want to go through that no
25:15
section by section oh you got all night we have we have five minutes left
25:21
in our Workshop anything you want to add to Sir special use no sir or are there
25:27
any topics that the board would like to see covered uh for training sessions in
25:33
the future I that's a really good use of the next five minutes because we usually come to the afternoon call and scratch
25:40
our heads about what's what's good topic although I thought the conversation
25:46
today was rather useful just in terms of the you know ulurp 101 stuff yeah um so
25:54
but yeah any other ideas you guys have on subject content for our workshops
25:59
throw them out anything come to mind for you um think for a minute yeah yeah
26:07
we've never gotten around to discussing uh uh having a discussion about uh with
26:15
the council about uh uh changes that we might recommend or things that they
26:20
might want look at um current zoning uh regulations that we've had to struggle
26:27
dealing with yeah I mean if it were Workshop worthy we might want to be a little bit more
26:32
specific on things that we want to specifically Workshop to potentially
26:38
bring to uh as I would be notes or recommendations to the city council so
26:45
yeah um that's I think it's a good use of Workshop time specifically the
26:51
transition Z the one that I microphone yeah I can't hear you on the video I think we've struggled with the
26:57
transition zone and some of the ways that uh buildings
27:02
um uh the regulations involved with that
27:08
yeah I have a procedural question to that end uh if a member of the board has
27:14
an issue like that where they they have a recommendation ready to go can they
27:19
move in any regular session to make a recommendation to the city council and then let the board vote on it or would
27:26
we prefer to like said kind of collect those things and do it in a special Workshop or but you have a you have a I
27:33
think a couple of avenues um ultimately at the end of the day it would be um
27:38
regardless of the mechanism it would be something presented to the council for consideration right by the planning
27:45
board as a whole so so the two mechanisms are you could we could do it as a board or you could do it as a
27:52
individual any of us at any time and um any of us at any time can make a recommendation to the city council so if
27:59
you if you feel like you know you'd want the board's input and sort of I guess
28:06
weight of the board on these recommendations yeah let's let's put them on the table let's talk about them
28:12
let's Workshop them yeah I think it'd be useful to have everybody's you know a broad uh uh U uh a broad cross-section
28:21
of opinion of the board on some of these issues you know rather than just having it be one issue that then gets voted up
28:27
or down you you know sort of like share experience and uh and get it Str I would
28:34
recommend that it be structured with an agenda and points to cover so that it's useful and job anyway agreed that's fine
28:42
yeah so we so we would have to because I mean let me to clarify one more thing I think we've been
28:48
told that it's not ideal for us to like be doing emails to the whole board because
28:54
it's almost becomes like a meeting right so we're not so we're encouraging not to communicate in that regard so we have to
29:00
remind ourselves to like hey two months from now we want to have a workshop everybody get a slate of things and then
29:07
maybe we give them all to John or we give them all to Jennifer individually and they get and then we our way through
29:13
them but myself and Mercedes are the sort of the conduits through which you know we would organize that uh to create
29:21
you know first to collect the ideas and then create an agenda from those ideas to be discussed so there's nothing wrong
29:26
with us as a board in our official capacity through City email sharing content
29:33
ideas with Mercedes and but we can't we can't all be emailing each other though
29:39
no we can't have substantive discussion about directly with each other over email that's we can make lists yes we're
29:45
good at that right put it in a spreadsheet Excel we can do excel so but yeah great idea so I yeah start to think
29:52
about what uh topics might be useful and what's can follow yeah great well that
29:58
was productive wow 2025 is off to a bang and it's right at 7:30 so welcome
30:05
everybody to the February 2025 meeting of the city of Beacon planning board uh
30:11
we're going to go to our regular meeting agenda after we uh take action on
30:18
approval of our December and January minutes so um I think we have everything in
30:26
order for December minutes so unless anybody has anything else to add as far
30:31

30:37

32:33
Studio LLC uh to my forever Valentine ra seagull dis mayay tonight is probably the first night in a few years where we

haven't been together on Valentine's Day so that gives them a few extra days to uh get a restaurant booked if they're not already there um in any event
32:46
tonight I'm joined by our architect AR seagull as well as our project engineer Justin dates and Phil gy of
32:52
kers um as the chairman mentioned we are before you all this evening in connection with our site plan and Seeker
32:58
public hearings in connection with the applicant's proposal to redevelop the property with two proposed four story
33:03
mixed use commercial buildings and multi family residential buildings to uh be located at 45 beakman Street and High
33:10
Street for the record the public hearing notice signage and Associated mailings were uh completed pursuant to the zoning
33:16
code requirements uh with proof of same supplied to the city uh as this is our
33:21
first public hearing on the project if I may uh for the benefit of any members of the public that are attending this
33:26
evening I'll provide a summary of the project uh and the evolution of it since our first appearance before you back in
33:32
December of 2023 uh so we're also uh having an anniversary as well um
33:38
property is generally located at the three intersections of North Avenue so New York State Route 9d and beakman as
33:43
well as High Street and beakman streets uh and the North Avenue New York State Route 90 and Tomkins Avenue uh the
33:49
property is generally comprised of three lots which are presently improved by uh the 45 beakman Street has a three-story
33:56
building commercial building in p parking and driveway areas uh you'll all have likely seen the uh Ron English
34:02
popart uh throughout the uh the city on the site both High Street Parcels are
34:08
currently vacant um and as some as you some of you may recall one of these Parcels closest to High Street was
34:14
actually previously utilized as a contractor's storage yard uh the applicant is proposing to demolish those
34:19
existing structures on the 45 beakman lot 45 beakman Street is uh irregularly shaped the lot that is um and it fronts
34:27
on North Avenue or New York State Route 9d Tomkins Avenue and beakman street with an existing curb cut providing
34:32
access to Tomkins Avenue and a driveway leading through one uh of the High Street Parcels to the existing curb cut
34:38
at beakman Street the 45 beakman Street parcel uh is set back uh generally from
34:43
in down uh from the abing beakman street and North Avenue is the site sits down uh there in the hill for those um that
34:50
take the turn there at beakman down towards the train station the two vacant High Street lots
34:55
are similarly regularly shaped um with frontages on beakman and high streets all three of lots are classified
35:01
in the city's linkage zoning district with a portion of the 45 beakman Street uh classified in the R1 7.5 as you
35:08
approach uh Tomkins and a portion of the vacant High Street Parcels also classified in the
35:14
HDO so there's some little pieces of the parcels um that sort of go up into those districts the premises generally
35:21
speaking are located across from City Hall and as you're all aware surrounding mixed use includes multif family including the high density uh multi M
35:27
residential developments of the view the West End Lofts River Ridge uh and single family developments in addition some
35:33
retail uh uses along the city's Main Street most recently the board approved a 62 unit four story multif Family
35:40
Residence uh on 16 West Main Street and known as Beacon Commons while ARA and Justin will go uh into this a little bit
35:46
further uh detail just for the benefit of the public at a high level ultimately the application site plan consisted
35:52
construction of two four-story buildings that are mixed use in furtherance of the purposes of the linkage District uh
35:58
which provides increased residential density and Commercial uses along Beekman Street leading into the Waterfront and the Main Street uh
36:04
Corridor so it's a linkage between those two areas the new building program consists of 64 apartments and
36:10
approximately 14,890 ft of commercial space the commercial space within each building hasn't been defined strictly as
36:17
retailer office um but our studies all take conservative approaches to each of those two uses Phil will address how uh
36:24
Phil gy will address how uh the proposed traffic and parking analysis so the project um evaluates each of those
36:29
components uh the multif family residences office and Retail uses are permitted uh as of right in this linkage
36:35
District both subsurface and surface parking areas uh comprise about 91 off Street oh excuse me comprise 91 off
36:42
street parking spaces uh and a proposed to service the project with 50 subsurface parking spaces proposed and
36:49
41 spaces within the garage level uh beneath the four-story building located at the 45 beakman
36:55
parcel all refer to that is the be building uh the beakman building will include the following so on the first
37:01
floor we have 10,566 ft of commercial space that's office and Retail and then about
37:07
2,247 ft of tenant amenity space on the second third and fourth floors we have 45 dwellings comprising 251 bedroom and
37:14
22 bedroom units which will also include below market rate units in accordance with the city's affordable Workforce
37:20
housing local law uh for the proposed four-story Building located on the lands comprising the High Street parcel the
37:26
program in includes about 4,326 ft of commercial again office and
37:31
Retail split and a residential Lobby and then again second third and fourth floors in this instance 19 dwelling
37:37
units uh eight of which are eight one bedrooms excuse me eight are one-bedrooms and 11 are two-bedroom
37:43
units uh and that again will have a mix of below market rate units in accordance with the city's below market rate unit
37:49
law the surface parking spaces are proposed to be located behind uh and amongst the new buildings all parking
37:56
areas will be accessed by these existing driveways located off of Tomkins and beakman Street existing sidewalks are
38:01
located along beakman Street and High Street Tomkins Avenue and North Avenue uh crosswalks are presently located on
38:07
the north side of the intersection across from North Avenue and the west side of the intersection across from beakman and the entrances to the
38:14
building will uh front on beakman Street uh as we detailed in our most recent supplemental submission uh on February
38:20
7th we did update the layout and configuration of certain pedestrian access points uh on the beakman street
38:26
us990 intersection that's been a a detailed discussion we've had with the uh the planning board the plans now
38:33
reflect what we believe to be a clear sidewalk connection uh from the intersection cornering with Main Street
38:38
and beakman building instead of varying the proposed Hardscape in that area uh as R will review the applicants are now
38:44
proposing a single paver treatment uh In Herring bone pattern no point we we considering or will we utilize stamped
38:50
uh pavement the new selected pattern visually simplifies the space and clearly distinguishes that access to the
38:56
building as as opposed to a concrete uh sidewalk circulation uh Mr dates will
39:01
also review the Landscaping shortly but at a high level we're pro proposing a diverse native plant pallet throughout
39:07
the site that includes additional shade and canopy trees uh an additional species of evergreen trees and buffering
39:12
uh in the neighborhood we're also proposing installing Landscaping in the streetscape improvements within the
39:18
Dot's rideway uh on North Avenue in order to increase the attractiveness of the the property as viewed from the
39:24
abing roadways and we're working to acquire certain portions the Dos right away to enlarge the overall project site
39:30
so ultimately this project was designed in furtherance of the city's comprehensive plan goals and the linkage District's um purposes it was to
39:38
establish again an assist in the transition from Main Street uh and the core of the Waterfront area um based on
39:43
these development goals uh we're proposing this to achieve those goals of creating enhancing that
39:51
transition then lastly but not leastly uh the procedural aspects of the application again we're here for site
39:57
plan application uh and a subdivision lot merger before this board uh the public hearing tonight is again specific
40:03
to the seeker and site plan reviews and not the public uh not the subdivision component of the application uh the
40:09
application has been designed to be ful fully zoning compliant with the exception of a specific off street
40:15
parking setback for specific parking spaces uh which is again a limited number of of those spaces and we will
40:21
pursue a variance uh from the zoning board of appeals for an area variance related to that uh setback
40:27
but for that we do understand the project uh does not require any relief from the zoning board or the city council uh the project has gone
40:33
undergone an extensive Architectural Review Board review with the subcommittee and then return to this board as the full arv review um at and
40:41
those included um a number of of different discussions and and and reiterations and updates to the plan uh
40:47
we revised the plan to respond to a number of the comments from the subcommittee and the board uh which included updating the the arcade walkway
40:54
uh treat treatments on the fenestration and the corner Tower to reflect less divisions in balancing the various
41:00
facade components um as another procedural update as we
41:06
noted at the last meeting and as part of tonight's discussion uh the application is considered a type one action uh in
41:12
accordance uh with Seeker uh our January 2nd submission to you all uh included a
41:18
detailed Seeker narrative that summarized how the applicants detailed submissions and presentations dating back to that original November 23 uh
41:25
2023 submission uh fully address the environmental review factors that are for your board's consideration uh we
41:31
have demonstrated an exhaustive analysis of of the review and and mitigation measures uh implemented by the project
41:36
team uh and and certainly uh would would seek uh support in in in pursuing a uh
41:42
negative Declaration of significance uh since the action is located within the city's Waterfront uh revitalization uh
41:48
program area we did also provide an lwrp consistency statement and that uh
41:54
conducts my um reintroduction uh for the benefit of the public at this time I'll just turn to arier who's got the site up
42:00
on the screen uh to go through uh the site
42:19
details good evening thank you TOR took most of my presentation as usual um I
42:26
I'll focus on the uh building design and the changes that we made since the last meeting and um
42:32
since we've had our discussions with the ARB and then the full board so we um
42:39
submitted just get it up here the latest renderings um you know
42:45
based on our last conversation so now we're sort of caught up with where we were with the renderings and where we
42:52
are with the conversation um we we also submitted the elev drawings with dimensions and notes
43:00
um I I do have part of the sample selection uh I'm still waiting for the
43:07
paint color so I was going to bring that in all together at the next meeting so
43:12
so we're not you know doing that in pieces um so yeah so basically the these
43:19
renderings show the um that gray green color instead of the dark charcoal gray
43:25
for the infill areas between the brick sections um you also have um that
43:32
elevator bulkhead was revised it actually got a little bit longer along
43:38
the front of the building but it's made of uh perforated metal similar to the finish of the um glass framing up there
43:45
you may want to sort of show those items that you're speaking to okay
43:54
yeah so the on on the you know fourth floor level the glass carries across um
44:01
and then above that where we have the elevator override it it's more of a you know like a equipment screen type of a
44:08
detail perforated metal and then that that would also um apart from you know
44:15
housing the elevator bulkhead it would also serve to screen the equipment that would be rooftop mounted and also you
44:22
know mitigate the noise from that equipment so although it got a little bit bigger I think it fits in better
44:27
with the the you know the rest of the building and the goal of um trying to
44:34
you know screen that material so it's not just up there um for everyone to see
44:39
and and that screen would be you know foursided all the way around
44:49
um we also had the uh renderer adjust that area between the buildings um and
44:56
include some cars in there so you can get a more realistic view of what the parking is like um there there was an
45:04
issue with how they were showing it previously but now now you can see that there's some parking spaces back there
45:09
and they're screened from the uh sidewalk view but um you know this is
45:15
more realistic about what's there we is the the grade in the in the
45:22
back in the background the grass grade does that reflect the actual grade it
45:27
doesn't reflect your landscape plan because there's a lot more screening close to the driveway Edge but I'm just
45:33
wondering about the grading it uh it's closer I mean I think they're they you
45:39
know they understood the idea of getting that to you know reflect what's happening you know I don't know if every
45:45
piece of the rendering is exact but the idea is really to you know give a flavor
45:50
and to show the building design but um you know this is a lot closer than what
45:56
what they had given us before and then also we have the
46:03
rendering of the corner that reflects the changes to the site plan um as
46:08
Taylor mentioned we're you know we're using uh Herring bone brick and we have
46:15
Planters there benches handrails that are also you know tied into the steps
46:21
and the ramps that we have there
46:31
yeah there there is we did talk about that telephone poll in the corner um uh
46:37
kers is going to be meeting with Central Hudson in the next week or so and discussing what may or may not happen to
46:44
that so uh for now we're not showing it in the rendering um there there's a chance of that might
46:52
move or be you know adjusted or something so we'll we'll get that figured out and then reflect what's
46:57
going
47:03
on I'll just go through the the other renderings here the changes here are just you know
47:11
the the same the the rooftop equipment screen the colors um and like I said
47:17
I'll get you actual color samples that that you can review High Time
47:25
View and then this just shows it from the approach where you're seeing the new
47:30
firehouse and City Hall and some of the other developments in the
47:38
area another view down peakman street you can see the arcade um and the stor
47:44
fronts through there evening view of that
47:52
one and so so that's pretty much where we are with the uh updates to the design
47:58
um and so like I said we're we're sort of caught up to where we last spoke
48:04
about that okay
48:18
thanks uh good evening Justin dates cers engineering design uh Taylor and AR
48:24
touched a lot on the site aspects um um one thing I just want to note the access
48:30
points uh as they exist today uh one on uh beakman and then one on Tomkins
48:35
Avenue those are our continued proposed access to the uh to the project site uh
48:41
I'm just going to touch briefly on the uh uh site plans and the uh the landscape uh and lighting plan that we
48:47
we have prepared for the project um as Taylor mentioned we did have a uh a diverse uh plant schedule of plant list
48:54
uh that we proposed for the for the uh project site and how we're treating the different areas between either
49:00
establishing screening for the adjacent uh Parcels or residential Parcels to the uh the west and the and the north uh
49:07
streetscape uh Improvement plantings uh Foundation accents and as well as um
49:14
vegetation FL within our uh storm motor uh Management areas so uh it is on sheet 12 of the uh of the
49:23
project plans if anyone has a chance to look at them uh but we're we're looking at from deciduous trees various species
49:31
of uh Maple Oak uh um uh honey locust uh
49:37
Evergreens which we're looking to establish as the uh screening uh to the as I said in the North and the West the
49:43
project site it's a mixed uh hedro essentially of we have Norway um Spruce
49:51
we have white pine we have Eastern red cedar uh some Ari as well as some uh
49:56
headside unipers so diverse mix different textures different you know colors uh but is substantially Evergreen
50:04
uh existing out in the site now if you've seen that is mostly deciduous uh so we recognize the need to uh really
50:11
supplement that for a more year-long uh screen of the project site from the uh the neighbors there uh We've also worked
50:19
in some canopy trees again to get some additional height uh we have pinoke in there which uh does uh hold his leaves
50:26
longer than than most deciduous trees so uh I've used that um on other projects
50:31
as also a you know type of screen uh for the uh that side of the site there uh
50:37
Street trees uh we have some mixed in on along beakman
50:43
um and then uh there's different ornamental trees uh flowering trees like cervice Berry uh we have also uh Eastern
50:51
red bud we have some horn beams and uh River perch as well as accents or
50:56
ornamental trees uh uh spread out around the site different types of shrubs
51:01
inkberry uh father Gila we have katoni Aster boxwood um different types of junipers
51:09
nine bark uh viburnums again a pretty diverse mixture of deciduous and
51:14
evergreen shrubs around the site with some perennial a uh accents regarding
51:20
the lighting for the project we are looking at dark skar compliant dark sky compliant fixtures uh we have poles as
51:26
well building mounting lights and also uh ballards uh to Accent Pathways and also
51:33
light up our uh parking area behind the uh the buildings so that's all I have for now I
51:41
just have a quick question on the planting uh the rendering of the um
51:46
Corner entrance on the north side of the plaza shows three kind of tall evergreen
51:53
looking um plants are are yeah that's off it's off to the right on
52:00
of that image there we don't we have uh lower grown we
52:09
have so so we have some boxwood the only upright uh vegetation we have there is
52:14
the horn beam there's only two on the corner there uh and then where we have
52:19
the uh planting adjacent to the sculpture pad there that's the koner so that's so that's low growing
52:27
okay got so so what we're seeing in the rendering as far as Landscaping is not representative of your actual
52:32
Landscaping plan is that right I think just that one what you're looking at there on the right there is that uppr
52:38
kind of conle plant um that's not really the shape or
52:45
form of a horn beam so is it would be slightly different but everything else is is low growing like
52:52
that so we could look to swap out those okay yeah I mean no we can I it's just
52:59
it's all a matter of you know the ability to read a landscaping plan which you know we are and we're doing um as
53:05
compared to you know what you're representing in the renderings which are a little bit more easily digestible you
