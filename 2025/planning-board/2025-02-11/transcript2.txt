53:11
know what I mean so it's just a matter of what certain people viewing will take
53:17
as what you're actually installing proposing sure right so when they when
53:22
they're disparate between the renderings and I understand why you know the Rings don't necessarily always follow
53:28
especially as it relates to the Landscaping sure there could be some confusion look for some just closer
53:34
match most better aligned y we'll work on that okay and then uh Phil gy uh from
53:42
kers just to speak on the traffic okay thank you thank
53:52
you uh good evening Philip gy from kyo's engineering and design uh we prepared the traffic and parking
53:59
study for this project I'll start with parking uh based on uh utilizing it uh
54:08
which is the Institute of Transportation Engineers data together with the uh city code uh we identified a peak demand of
54:16
89 parking spaces so the proposed uh parking would accommodate that in terms
54:22
of peak utilization the traffic study uh which was done we've been working together
54:29
with New York state do and your consultant on the review of that work
54:34
the traffic study identified existing conditions uh included traffic
54:40
projections for the site as well as traffic projections for projects that
54:46
are either approved not yet built or projects that are in the review process
54:51
in the city and uh looked at uh certain mitigation based based on those combined
54:57
uh traffic numbers uh the mitigation called for modifications to the phasing
55:04
at North Avenue uh 9d and beakman Street uh we had recent conversations with New
55:11
York state do uh they are in agreement with that phasing modification uh they also are requiring
55:19
us to upgrade some of the crosswalks to add an additional crosswalk um and then uh we had also
55:27
looked at uh the project has significant ride of way along uh North Avenue we had
55:36
looked at the provision of a right turn lane Southbound on North Avenue uh do
55:43
does not want that constructed at this point in time but there is room with the project to allow for that if it needed
55:50
in the future and uh in terms of the land along peakman Street there's excess
55:58
land that the dot has and we are in the process of obtaining that uh that review
56:06
has been completed in the regional office and they have agreed with uh that
56:13
it's now in Albany uh with the per group and make the determination on the uh uh
56:23
movement of that property uh to us so that is still ongoing quick question if
56:29
you don't mind actually maybe two just relative to that the the excess land and that transfer is any part of that a part
56:36
of the F potential future R turn lane or they totally distinct okay it's it's all long beepen and then just curious
56:45
whether um in their sharing with you as you just stated that they're they don't
56:51
like the idea of introducing the right-and turn lane right now do they say
56:56
why um they two reasons one is for pedestrian movements they prefer not to
57:03
have a added Lane at that location and looking at the volumes they felt that it wasn't needed now they looked at the
57:11
design in terms of to make sure the ability of that if it was needed in the future could be constructed um and I
57:18
think that's you know the gist of it I curious whether they gave you a rationale I don't know if they uh you're
57:25
Consulting I we had a call with uh Ken and John with do I don't know if there
57:31
was any further discussion of it but keeping them honest no they on the
57:38
Mr gley is correct they were concerned with lengthening um the crosswalk there by adding the additional Lane and they
57:45
didn't feel the volumes uh warranted a right turn lane at this and then just the last question
57:52
um just because you covered it the signaling changes which they agreed be necessary that you recommended
58:00
they're going to implement those then we we will have to implement them as part of our permit uh they may decide to do
58:07
it beforehand but right now it's our responsibility to make those changes as part of the project they are finishing
58:15
their uh adaptive system they're I think working on the final touches the
58:20
Adaptive system that runs from beakman up through the id4 interchange that's been in the work
58:26
they're in the process of finalizing that now so thank you okay thank you
58:32
very much what else that's it for now that's
58:39
it indeed okay so good we'll um we'll make our way around the table um
58:45
starting with our consultants and then we'll go to the public um Natalie I know you have some notes you highlighted for
58:51
the applicant yeah um perhaps you want to share maybe highlight them for us as well thank you yeah I think some of it
58:57
has already been touched upon um one that there was just the cons consistency between the rendering and the site plan
59:03
I think you already kind of talked about that especially just kind of that middle space um and the front Plaza and I think
59:10
just those are two critical aspects kind of in the of The Pedestrian experience so where we can kind of better align
59:16
those I think would be helpful for visualizing the project um both for the board and the public um second comment
59:24
has to do about the main entrance on the corner of beakman and Route 9d um I
59:31
appreciate the applicant made changes based on the comments made at the last planning board meeting there's previously a number of different kind of
59:38
pedestrian access points at that corner that made it look a little bit convoluted and so what they've done to
59:43
kind of open up that space so no matter what crosswalk you're Crossing at you kind of you you a light you get off
59:50
right there and you're kind of at the entrance and you're at that Plaza so I think those changes are definitely supportable in terms of
59:56
simplifying and opening up that space um and then I appreciate the comment about the poll this is kind of came up in the
1:00:02
conversation there is and again this maybe goes back to point one in terms of just showing us I know that it might not
1:00:08
be possible to maybe move those poles necessarily but it's worth kind of just considering that as part of the design
1:00:14
of this Plaza because there is a large utility pole there as well as a pedestrian Crossing button so as we're
1:00:20
thinking about the design of the plaza I think that just helps to to think about it and yeah so that's I appreciate side
1:00:26
by side too it's really accurate this is the poll you're talking about yeah yeah there's the utility poll and then the
1:00:31
push button so now that we've widened it you know that that the plaza is widen you can maybe easily navigate around
1:00:38
those but I just I think it's helpful to kind of see them together so you know what what the experience will actually
1:00:43
be yeah I know that's super helpful um applicant mentioned that there there there may be some movement uh of that
1:00:49
poll is that did I hear that correctly I'll let Justin speak to it but cers is going to be meeting with with Central
1:00:55
Hudson to consider go ahead yeah we're going we're going be meting with Central hon just to see um
1:01:02
what could possibly if anything be done with the poll there are other poles along the line of beak bin that we're also looking at one definitely needs to
1:01:09
be relocated for the construction of the building um and then we'll also just speak to them about this particular poll
1:01:15
fals it are rather unfortunate I mean people could certainly walk around it but just in terms of your Plaza it's
1:01:20
probably the worst part possible yeah yeah I think that the the the pole and also the the uh the ped uh ped pole
1:01:26
there is kind of close together there so you know it's not kind of stretching out across the entire uh um walkway area so
1:01:34
if anything they are you know kind of condensed in one location then we can get away around that so yeah and I I
1:01:40
will say just as far as the updates you've made to again I call it Plaza it sounds more
1:01:46
Grand than it is but that corner condition um simplification much better
1:01:52
great appreciate that thank you yeah thanks for putting the work in appreciate
1:01:58
it um and then the last comment um happy to hear that we're that the all the
1:02:04
lighting is dark sky compliant I think we had just talked about um the additional specifications for
1:02:12
lighting were forthcoming let me
1:02:17
just oh so I we were the part lighting that we have seen as discussed is kind
1:02:23
of the ballards on the exterior and then the holes in the parking facility um so
1:02:28
I was just kind of curious that the AR arcade on the ground floor is an interesting and kind of unique aspect of
1:02:34
this development so was curious to know what the exterior lighting within that arcade is going to be to ensure that
1:02:40
that space is is lit um so I think that that piece is still forthcoming yeah yes
1:02:47
um so that just keeping that comment on there until we see those okay that's it thanks speaking of forthcoming John you
1:02:53
have a list of things still yet to be well I do and a lot of their comments they're waiting to hear back from do on
1:03:00
the acquiring of the land before they move um forwards with addressing some of
1:03:05
the comments they're still working on the utilities um as we were concerned some of the homes on Tomkins may be tied
1:03:13
into the private sore line that runs through they have found one they still have not been able to dest some of the
1:03:19
other homes there although they continue to make temps um they haven't been able to confirm whether they tie into this
1:03:26
sore line that runs through their property or if it actually ties out uh I spoke with Colliers today they're
1:03:33
looking at trying to get out there again and knock on some doors and also televis a sore on Tomkins to see if they can
1:03:40
make some determinations um they did submit a Swip
1:03:46
that Swip is now going to need to be updated to reflect the new storm water
1:03:51
regulations that were just adopted so they'll take care of that and
1:03:56
then the other thing I was noticing is the site section diagrams looking from High Street towards the
1:04:03
buildings on the back of the property on the property line you have a stone wall retaining wall that exists along the but
1:04:10
these sight sections are not showing that wall system at all it's just showing the
1:04:16
slope so those should be updated reflect those walls that are existing there that
1:04:21
walls wind in your parcel uh it's shared property L it's on a shared
1:04:28
property line shared property line but they're showing views from houses further up High Street
1:04:33
down we can only show the views from the public perspective from the roads we can't it wouldn't be it either
1:04:40
appropriate to show views from a single family from a residence it's public view locations so the views that we'll be
1:04:46
able to provide well I think there's an there was a comment this evening that was able to provide a view from their
1:04:51
property we're we we're limited to the public rights of way what I know what you just they're
1:04:57
showing it already in here yeah and showing views from the back of the house are you talking about take views
1:05:04
photographs so we're talking about the site sections where we can provide so I see okay sorry y two different things
1:05:11
than I think John is mentioning we have the site section which is effect right right versus there result all I'll just
1:05:17
stop talking yeah you confuse I don't want to confuse anybody John knows where I'm going so they they had sheet a 104
1:05:26
had site sections looking what people would see the perspectives looking from High Street um towards the building on
1:05:33
High Street towards the one on beakman y um but in those sections they're not
1:05:38
showing the retaining wall that's on right as far as I understand you can only take it from the public
1:05:45
space but these plans are also showing perspective views from somebody towards
1:05:50
the right I was speaking to the VIS like the actual going to what the chairman was saying which is a like a photograph
1:05:55
visual representation like that versus the the height of where that property is
1:06:00
through the site which is what this is representing and there's a public comment that was included in your in in
1:06:06
the packet tonight that is included that has photographs from a resident property
1:06:11
so I think you'll see that may maybe more clear later it will become very clear later okay anything else John no
1:06:20
not at this time okay board any questions or other observations for the applicant I just had some information I
1:06:26
wanted to uh you mentioned there were new storm water regulations yes uh new
1:06:32
general permit next month the training next month new general permit
1:06:39
025 for construction activity okay has been issued by DEC became effective
1:06:46
January 29th like SK protection that sort of thing more or less defines what
1:06:52
can be done during construction how what's allowed to be used so on and so forth forth um so any Swip that's
1:06:59
currently under design they'll have to update to include all the requirements of that permit thanks I just was curious
1:07:06
you're welcome anything else nobody else to C nothing okay so
1:07:16
we'll go to the public um just by raise of hands uh how many people are here to speak on on this tonight
1:07:28
I'll put it right here how many people are here so okay great how many people are here to
1:07:36
speak on this particular thank you um so just real quick I'm going to go through our guidelines for comment at public
1:07:42
hearing part of which talks about timing for uh public comment but um just I'll
1:07:48
run through this um because it's always good to refresh speakers must step to
1:07:53

1:08:20
hearing may not exceed 5 minutes there's instances where we can reduce time but we'll allow just that's why I did the
1:08:26
raise of hands um we'll allow five minutes for each uh speaker um 5 minutes max please
1:08:35
um speaker shall observe commonly accepted rules of courtesy decorum dignity and good taste any statements

1:09:47
they you have a oh you're the gentleman with the PowerPoint yeah I had because it you know technical everything is I
1:09:53
sent you a copy of my PowerPoint yep um but let me see if I can get this much
1:10:00
better so
1:10:10
um and just a quick reminder um five minutes max
1:10:24
please oh thank you Lenn usually Lynn usually is quick with the clock just

1:10:44
what you
1:10:56
I think she put it on there oh now you've done it here he
1:11:04
comes yeah I'm trying to get to my desktop
1:11:18
actually how was this uncovered it's got to go I'm sorry so
1:11:23
how was this uncovered that's it's always been there it's
1:11:29
software the wall you mean well the historical nature of it yeah I mean I in the runup to this application I went to
1:11:37
the beacon historical society and asked for um sandborn maps and photos of
1:11:42
existing buildings that on this property and any are we good to go looks like it
1:11:49
okay I was a little seeing your other uh uh things I was I was hoping that you'd
1:11:55
be able to see some of the my uh pictures and stuff anyways my name is Robert fito thank you uh I live at 16
1:12:03
High Street and I border this project on the High Street beakman side and I
1:12:08
border about 177 ft um which I'll go through this this um
1:12:17
so and I'm going to comment on a couple things there are some questions about a grassy null which doesn't exist and I
1:12:25
actually had pictures of the retaining wall which is like 139 years old cuz my
1:12:30
house was built in 1889 so with the
1:12:36
do let's get this [Music]
1:12:46
here so what I'm going to go through I'm going to do a short introduction I'm going to go over beakman Street and High
1:12:52
Street Key site plan 16 High High Street property map of survey High Street
1:12:58
elevations High Street building project rear parking lot 16 High Street
1:13:04
retaining wall details 16 High Street retaining wall additional photos
1:13:09
suggested suggestion additional retaining wall additional concerns and
1:13:14
current view of historic High Street so this paper highlights an
1:13:20
existing historical uh retaining wall which represents the property line between between 16 High Street and 45
1:13:27
beakman Street and High Street commercial and residential mixed use
1:13:32
project the mix oh sorry okay the mix use project
1:13:38
shows a parking lot behind the building which could compromise the existing retaining wall structure and in turn
1:13:45
cause significant property damage to 16 High Street the adjacent property due to
1:13:50
erosion from rain water and melting snow High Street properties are built on a
1:13:56
hill where the mixed use project sits at the bottom of this hill this paper will
1:14:01
highlight concerns pertaining to a needed setback when constructing the parking lot and recommendations on how
1:14:08
to ensure the Integrity of this historical High Street retaining
1:14:17
wall okay so this over here is the uh full key plan I'm going to be
1:14:23
concentrating over here to the right hand side of the uh beakman High Street
1:14:29
um project and as you see they did put a little black line on here for a
1:14:35
retaining wall and it actually goes along and it goes all the way up here
1:14:40
which is this is my property okay so this is my property site plan
1:14:50
okay 16 High Street structure was built in 1889 the wall age is possibly 136
1:14:57
years old 16 High Street dwelling garage my garage which is right here is only
1:15:04
16' 8 in from that retaining wall which is the shared property line okay my
1:15:11
property line shared property line is 116 ft to the that that uh where that
1:15:19
mixed use buildings going with the proposed uh parking lot and then there's
1:15:24
uh additional 57 ft uh behind my house where additional parking lot will go the
1:15:30
57t section has already been compromised by erosion okay I'll get to that in a
1:15:35
second and my understanding and looking at my um survey in site plan is that
1:15:42
that retaining wall is my property line that my property owns
1:15:48
it so that's something might be some question as to be looked at this here is a top topographical map
1:15:56
of Beacon okay so Beacon topic map shows
1:16:01
the steepness of High Street okay at the top of High Street you're at 140 ft okay
1:16:08
you come down to my house 16 High Street you've already dropped to 120 ft okay
1:16:14
and then you come down to where the project is the beakman High Street project is AT3 ft okay so water from
1:16:22
rain and melting snow eventually flow to the the proposed project site uh red
1:16:28
indicates the building which I have right here if you can see these these topographical lines you can understand
1:16:33
how steep this is okay so the retaining the retaining wall is crucial to
1:16:39
preventing erosion and maintaining the Str the structural Integrity of 16 High
1:16:44
Street property right so this is my house right here okay you look at these this uh
1:16:51
topographical map and I look at my window and after heavy snows and rain this property is is very very wet and
1:17:00
that's why they're not probably not doing a garage in that site because they'd have an inground swimming pool to be honest with you
1:17:07
so this is here what they proposed The High Street Building rear parking lot
1:17:12
and again as you had said this does not um represent at all what the actual lot
1:17:19
looks like okay and they can walk in here and take pictures just real quick you're at 5 minutes so let's oh oh okay
1:17:27
I'll go quick so so my my house um is a lot closer and there's a retaining wall
1:17:32
this doesn't really show and and this length of this uh parking lot you're saying 99.5 ft I'm not sure where that
1:17:40
ends so here what we're talking about before this is the actual retaining wall
1:17:45
and this retaining wall is a handbuilt retaining wall used with no mortar and
1:17:50
there's a hill that comes down that supports this retaining wall as as you can see here um over the years people
1:17:58
have taken whove used this this uh lot and have owned the lot they've they've over the years have nibbled away at this
1:18:05
dirt here and they've gotten as close as they can before if they take any more dirt out of this this uh coming up the
1:18:11
retaining wall this retaining wall structure will probably start to fail in my properties and start sliding
1:18:17
down okay and I'm only like I said 16 18 ft from this sorry can I just interrupt
1:18:23
you here and ask a question the conclusion you get to is that the proposal to do a 3ft retaining
1:18:30
wall going along the front where are you getting that from well so I'm right there in the next
1:18:38
slide I'll talk about that so this is just stepping back and see how the prior people have had this lot have just dug
1:18:44
away and you see this wall way up there you can't remove any more of this dirt
1:18:49
okay or this wall is going to uh start failing so so this is what you're just
1:18:56
talking about so taking this map that they have and I don't I'm taking it in
1:19:01
the question you know the visual and such they have this retaining wall here
1:19:07
they have this parking lot so basically what I'm saying where that Hill is if they're going to build this parking lot
1:19:13
they they if they were to build it right up to that retaining wall which is my wall I believe that wall is going to uh
1:19:20
be compromised and my property compromised that whole side of the Hill is kind to be compromised so if this
1:19:27
project goes forward there needs to be kind of a set this is only proposing about a setback say 20 ft where they
1:19:33
could build a 3ft retaining wall use back fill from the project and put shrubs and stuff and it would look
1:19:39
really nice but it will it will retain that retaining wall and that structural Integrity of the
1:19:48
hill so this here is the lot looking down at from my house you see right here
1:19:54
and look at this I'm right right there so this is very crucial to me that this hill doesn't start breaking away and
1:20:00
sliding who's going to pay for my house right another thing is uh 25% of of this
1:20:07
of High Street is now going to be open to this lot coming up High Street and another thing they didn't show is you
1:20:13
see these trees there's a huge canopy of matur trees that runs along beakman
1:20:18
Street runs here along theide a High Street here which protects all these
1:20:24
homes here the view of this property and also behind it's all homes you don't
1:20:29
have that grassy null going up it's actually very Steep and you have trees there which will probably be taken down
1:20:35
so all these beautiful natural trees are going to be like taken down for what you
1:20:41
know put up a shrub so this is the existing picture of High Street from
1:20:47
right outside the door here and uh this is what it's been looking like For What
1:20:53
100 years and my might be the last time if this project really goes forward that you'll actually see the picture see
1:20:58
picture of High Street like this but you can also see the steepness of this and
1:21:04
this is why I'm very concerned about my property 177 ft along this they cannot
1:21:11
take that Hill out and they cannot put a parking lot up to that wall and thank you very much I don't
1:21:17
know if you have any questions I did send this to you you guys have it thank you okay
1:21:25
okay um [Music] next Teresa he took eight he took eight
1:21:32
minutes so you only get two and where's your PowerPoint I left
1:21:37
my paper in the printer at the last meeting I was at my name is Teresa craft I live in ward 3 I'm opposed to the
1:21:44
scale of this project and do not believe it should be granted site plan and subdivision approval there is nothing
1:21:50
peaceful and calming in this proposal and it would negatively impact Thea traffic flow and safety at this already
1:21:56
congested intersection this is an unsightly project crammed into the gateway into Beacon it will be an isore
1:22:03
not a destination it hits on all the marks that will tarnish what is left of this coming quarter the light pollution
1:22:09
will look like the Blazing Hospital across the river its Clock Tower will look like an air traffic control tower
1:22:15
the surrounding neighbors impacted by this project should not be denied their quality of life existence if you are to
1:22:22
approve this project based on this long longwinded submission and interpretations based on their own unreasonable request Beacon might not as
1:22:30
well have a building inspector no city building codes and no zba vote no please these public hearings
1:22:37
come too late in the planning process as we have heard earlier this evening this has been on the table for years there
1:22:44
are built in approvals and backdoor agreements you might deny that they happen at this table but they happen in
1:22:49
this Administration long before the public can voice their opinions and valid concerns we see it time and time
1:22:55
again unfortunately in the building approval process in the city of Beacon a lot of the applicants time and monies
1:23:01
are spent in developing overdeveloped site plans drawings parking studies traffic studies mostly all designed by
1:23:08
the same cookie cutter architect and represented by the same legal firm reading the application and submissions
1:23:14
it's easy to see the these comparisons from one project to another whatever is decided for that corner will impact the
1:23:21
look and feel of this community as a whole stop giving this applicant Hope by sending them back to make minor changes
1:23:27
to fit into the historic streetcape just say no please deny the site plan and subdivision approval thank
1:23:36
you anyone else
1:23:48
please hello my name is Katie helmouth can you hear me yep okay uh I live in w
1:23:55
11 okay sorry go ahead to over just yeah thank you and I
1:24:01
won't slou over yeah repeat your address please I interrupted you there we go my name is Katie helmouth living in W 1 17
1:24:08
Willis Street um I am in favor of this proposed project as a four-story building it seems like it will sit low
1:24:14
from the street the garage seems convenient if anything I would wish that there was more apartment units in this
1:24:20
building and others throughout the city that would include three and four bedrooms if the demand is there there are
1:24:27
families who have trouble moving out of their two-bedroom apartments to stay in Beacon families have been moving out in
1:24:33
search of more space there is a submitted comment letter from Neighbors in 30 beakman Street stating that they
1:24:39
are concerned about traffic and noise congestion they say currently there's a lot of development develop happening
1:24:45
within Beacon and the concern is that we lose the quietness of why we bought a place in Beacon and fear that Beacon
1:24:51
becomes too overdeveloped too quickly I I believe 30 beakman street is the large
1:24:56
apartment complex called The Views that is across the street from this proposed building that building also has four
1:25:03
stories and is quite large and quite nice I've been inside to attend events on the top floor since the views got
1:25:10
built this area seems to still be quiet I am not understanding why neighbors would want in a large apartment building
1:25:17
are refusing to have a similar apartment building built across the street from them as for the number of commercial
1:25:23
units offered based on how quickly storefronts on Main Street are being filled when a business leaves it seems
1:25:30
like I'm going to breathe these storefronts will find interest interested businesses large commercial
1:25:37
spaces seem to be more difficult to fill having more commercial storefront spaces may help keep rent and check on Main
1:25:43
Street but it might not matter as people still want to be on Main Street if there is more parking down there than that is
1:25:50
a draw for customers each will be in a different environment and does not seem like it will be a threat to Main Street
1:25:56
the concept of the arcade seems nice Brett's hardware and two-way Brewery may not mind the increase foot traffic this
1:26:03
will generate 2way Brewery has was once for sale and it may help with a future sale if there are more people down there
1:26:09
thank you thank you
1:26:21
next all right uh my name is edin Chong I live on 20 High Street um and just
1:26:26
earlier there was talking about the idea of compatibility with the surrounding neighborhood um and I'm not sure if that
1:26:32
was mentioned in relation to this project um in particular but I do think it's an important um consideration um to
1:26:39
preserving Beacon's character right and I think um we've seen renderings of these buildings in in isolation and in
1:26:44
relation to each other um but I'd really like to you know have them also considered in the context of the
1:26:50
surrounding houses on on High Street um since part of that development fronts on High Street um and High Street as I'm
1:26:58
sure some of you are aware right has a really distinct aesthetic um you know for example in New York Times in talking
1:27:03
about Beacon has highlighted High Street in particular you know noting the brightly colored Victorian houses that line it and I'm wondering how this
1:27:09
proposal kind of lines up um against that and again even here you know it's kind of the two buildings but not really
1:27:16
in in in relation to what's on what's on High Street and I think it's an important um consideration when thinking
1:27:21
about how new developments fit into this and and kind of maintaining consistency
1:27:26
um and cohesiveness and character with with the rest of the surrounding neighborhood um and the city itself cuz I think we can all appreciate
1:27:33
responsible growth uh but I think it needs to happen in a way that fits with the existing city um and to the point
1:27:39
about I guess um you other developments lining lining beakman yes it's true
1:27:45
there are similar buildings to this but again I think they fit in um with with
1:27:50
what's on with what's on that side of of beakman right you have the view fitting with with West End LOF and that that
1:27:56
maintains the consistency but in relation to the victorians that line on High Street I think this is um a little
1:28:01
bit different so um just kind of would love to have that taken into consideration when considering approval
1:28:06
of this project thank
1:28:18
you hi my name is uh James Ellinger I'm at West Church Street uh I strongly
1:28:23
oppose the development of as presented for 45 beakman development fails on
1:28:29
multiple fronts to comply with the state goals and mandates of the city of Beacon Council and the clearly written policies
1:28:34
namely the comprehensive plan and the linkage District plan which stipulate clear guidelines regarding compatibility
1:28:39
character design standards specifically stating preserve and enhance the unique character of the city of Beacon and
1:28:46
support a sense of design context that appropriate appropriately relates to historic buildings uh General facade
1:28:52
window patterns and traditional Street Scapes uh the proposed beon plan fails
1:28:57
to meet these mandates in the following ways the scale first of all the proposed building buildings dwarf all buildings
1:29:04
in the immediate area significantly on each one of the three corners of beakman and 9d you'll find city hall
1:29:10
historically designated single one to four family residences in the current form they would overshadow and dominate
1:29:16
the landscape and what can be described as the entrance to the business district of Beacon structures of this size failed
1:29:23
the basic tenant of a comprehensive plan as it states quote new construction should be comparable with its
1:29:28
surroundings as related to footprint size setting roof line building envelope size scale and mass uh to the Aesthetics
1:29:37
um the proposed building misses the Aesthetics points P pointed out by the comprehensive plan and the linkage
1:29:42
District documents drawings show dark greed buildings with sections of brick which do not match the character uh of
1:29:49
the area where historically designated colors are required uh furthermore the city documents
1:29:54
specifically state that metal siding is not to be used and shall not be permitted this development is a wash of
1:30:00
metal siding not window framing as has been suggested uh three the environmental
1:30:06
footprint uh the descriptions of non-environmental impact beg further research from the east north and west
1:30:13
all water flows down to the site the extensive tree and shrub anchors that exist are likely the main deterrent from
1:30:19
serious groundwater issues residents have noted that manhole covers in the area of two-way Brewing have expelled
1:30:25
volumes of water and that pressure on 90 is not currently adequate in addition
1:30:30
the linkage District plan rendering show clear distinct uh tree covering between
1:30:36
the street and the sidewalk the street transition zone creating an essential barrier between pedestrians and vehicle
1:30:42
traffic the bakman plant ignores this guidance by offering minimal trees and aligns them close to the structure
1:30:47
leaving an uncovered and open area between the sidewalk and the street uh for the traffic the traffic study uh did
1:30:54
not show the one key data element necessary to assess the intersection of beakman and 90 that is the volume of
1:31:01
traffic flowing out in that sits idle in the intersection during the busy periods
1:31:06
leaving the train station any changes in the area should include input from traffic uh Beacon traffic and safety um
1:31:13
so that that issue is not exacerbated as I understand they have not been called into to this to
1:31:19
comment uh the proposal fails uh in summary by not following the regulations and requirements and by not considering
1:31:26
the realities of of beacon in this very prominent location The Proposal uses the comprehensive plan and the linkage
1:31:33
District as justification when the city is suffering under the weight of overdevelopment astronomical rents both
1:31:38
residential and Commercial and a crisis of affordability an embarrassing frustrating commentary on our city is
1:31:44
that this very property used to house spyer Studios home to artists and part of the vibrant creative class that
1:31:50
Beacon owes its every penny of growth to most of all or most if not all of those
1:31:56
artists no longer have studios in Beacon many have been forced out of Beacon due to affordability that performative
1:32:02
language in The Proposal mocks the original intent of our sa priorities saying that the area will be vibrant
1:32:08
over and over mimic what was once an issue for Beacon but is fundamentally to ignore the realities of 45 beakman this
1:32:15
development brings nothing to beakman or Beacon its residence its Community its character it's simply an awkward out of
1:32:22
Step development I strongly urge the planning board to look closely at where this proposal fails to meet the
1:32:27
directives laid out in the comprehensive plan and the linkage District plan in both 45 beakman runs counter to the
1:32:35
stated requirements and I also urge a sincere and reflective look at what this
1:32:40
development means to the character of Beacon and what it signals about our community values and commitment to what
1:32:45
makes Beacon unique unique as a chair noted this is an opportunity missed I could not agree more in its current
1:32:52
state the development means an opportunity missed wholly and entirely thank you thank
1:33:00
you
1:33:07
next my name is l for this is Mary ell and case we live on nine High Street um
1:33:14
everything that everybody says pretty much relevant to what's going on is just that where the building on beakman and
1:33:22
uh 9d are that is a big drainage ditch that they're Turing on to and it's 20 ft
1:33:28
below the ground as it is now and they're going to put a parking garage down in there I don't see how the
1:33:34
wetlands are going to allow that to happen Okay and the building is not
1:33:41
historically suited to whatever else is in the in the area it just looks like an
1:33:47
industrial building but a lot of glass and a lot of metal some brick and it doesn't look like it in the area that's
1:33:55
what I have to say I would and I'm marielen case can you hear
1:34:00
me okay yeah um so we live at N9 High Street it's I can't even tell what it's
1:34:05
going to look like across from our house because we see nothing of the back of these renderings so right now we have you know
1:34:14
some trees I don't know if the um development that's supposed to go in next to two-way That was supposed to
1:34:21
happen if that's happening too you know you know I call it the Raceway down to the train because of where we sit we see
1:34:27
the cars racing all the time to make the train so I think there's issues with traffic lighting ever since 30 beakman
1:34:33
came in and this time of year we can't even look out our bedroom window cuz we're so up high and all I see is that
1:34:40
all the lights going up the walkway um High Street's a one she was
1:34:45
was a one-way Street not when I've lived here so far but I can see how it's very dangerous um as a two-way particularly
1:34:51
on this one spot of the Hill we've had issues with our sewer um just because we
1:34:57
are at toward the bottom so I think that there's just going to be continuous issues I was very upset about whether or
1:35:03
not the building would historically fit in just because we've really worked hard to really make our houses as nice as we
1:35:10
can it's not cheap um so I'm vehemently if that's such a word opposed to this
1:35:16
development I I think that it doesn't fit in with High Street um particularly um I I have office on the
1:35:24
corner of Tomkins and 9d there's constantly traffic backed up so I sort
1:35:29
of challenge how it cannot be a traffic issue as well and uh I guess maybe
1:35:36
that's just about it thank you for today sorry if you do have more please
1:35:42
into the mic thank you on the street look okay but what about behind that's
1:35:48
what I saying I have no behind to see thank you what what are we going to inclusive look like behind there cuz
1:35:55
I've walk through there all the time with my dogs and it doesn't seem like all that space is going to be seems like
1:36:00
a lot of building in a little small space it just seems that way thank you thank
1:36:08
you anyone
1:36:16
else uh traditionally we we do prepare uh written responses to these comments which we're certainly pleased to do um
1:36:22
and we'll always do um but if the board had specific questions that they wanted us to try and address this evening um we
1:36:28
could certainly do so um but notably we're we're going to prepare responses to these six comments yeah no I was I
1:36:35
was going to emphasize I think a number of these issues you may want to address
1:36:40
and um you know obviously uh you're doing so will make them a part of the
1:36:45
public record so folks here who have expressed their concerns will have the ability to hear from you uh directly uh
1:36:53
so thank you um I will also mention that there have been a number of letters
1:37:01
received those are all as they've been received now a part of the official record as well as the public comment
1:37:08
here so uh we will keep the public hearing open um and if I may the two comment
1:37:15
letters that were received in writing those were two commenters that also spoke tonight so there's only been two other letters received and so yeah yes
1:37:23
okay okay oh wait yeah there's only there was only two letters received on this application only two okay I'm sorry
1:37:29
I thought I saw more maybe that was another public hearing another application okay yes because there quite
1:37:34
quite a few for that one um great so great and if I may uh just for you know
1:37:40
for purposes of procedure um understanding that we're involved in the Seeker review uh as part of this hearing
1:37:45
if the board might see fit and and in asking or or uh considering having its attorney prepare a draft uh Seeker uh
1:37:52
determination that goes through these factors that way we can try and walk through I think many of these items are already addressed in much of our
1:37:58
materials but we'll certainly be sure to respond to the more in more depth um but just to ask that it might be uh set for
1:38:04
uh drafting a resolution that we might walk through it's not saying to ask the board to make a secret determination but be able to review these specific items
1:38:11
yeah no I think it's a good interval to do just that to um authorize draft and spend time uh reviewing that draft
1:38:19
together next month so uh with that I will um ask for a motion to authorize
1:38:26
Jennifer's office to develop draft determination on
1:38:32
secret do I have a motion motion motion by Len second second by Karen all in
1:38:40
favor anything else we can do this evening for you that is it thank you thank you keep the public we are I just
1:38:47
mentioned that we're keeping the public hearing open yep so next item on the agenda
1:38:57
is um public hearing and continued review of applications for site plan approval and subdivision approval mixed
1:39:03
use commercial use and residential 420 430 Fishkill Avenue submitted by DK
1:39:09
realy [Music] LLC uh good evening I used my joke so
1:39:14
now I'm going right into this uh presentation this evening you got one and that's it used it up we're done
1:39:20
right for the record sale with the one I'm sorry Jennifer go ahead yeah let me just so before we start public hearing
1:39:27
on this I just I think it makes sense um given what's going on at the city council to to have a little bit of a a
1:39:35
precursor uh to the public hearing and I know Taylor's going to go through a presentation of of the application for
1:39:40
the benefit of the public um but obviously the planning board is aware
1:39:46
that the city council has discussed the introduction of a local law that would
1:39:51
prohibit drive-through facilities throughout the city of Beacon um which would include this site obviously um
1:39:58
regardless of those discussions the planning board also understands that um its legal obligation is to continue to
1:40:05
process this application based on the law that exists today which allows uh
1:40:10
drive-through facilities on this site uh that's already been a determination made by the building inspector back in
1:40:18
December um uh and the building inspector is the city official charged with the legal responsibility for
1:40:25
interpreting the zoning code um so the planning board will continue to process this application in the same fashion
1:40:31
that it has been doing and in the same fashion as any other application um last month the planning board scheduled a
1:40:37
public hearing to be heard tonight um tonight you know the board will open that public hearing we'll consider
1:40:43
whether to close it um and we'll consider whether to direct a resolution um after the public hearing
1:40:50
uh comments have been heard um I know that the applicant is aware of
1:40:56
the legislation that is being discussed at the city council but just for the record I want to make sure you know that
1:41:02
the applicant uh confirms that they are aware of that um and indicates that they
1:41:08
do want to proceed tonight with the application thank you Mr Gray yes we are aware and we are proceeding with the
1:41:13
application and we are certainly also in communication now with the city council with respect to uh hopeful suggestions
1:41:19
that they consider adjustments uh to the way that language is more consistent with the rec the the recommendations of
1:41:24
the planning board uh at a presentation back in December um so ultimately we're uh certainly reached out to the council
1:41:30
and let them know uh our concerns with specifically or narrowly tailoring uh new law towards uh the specific project
1:41:36
so we're proceeding as as Miss gray said uh with our public looking to proceed with the public hearing tonight good so
1:41:44
that we can have a motion to open the public hearing I I love a good sort of attorney rep parte at the beginning of every single application that's nice um
1:41:51
yes with that uh first order of business is uh a motion to open the public
1:41:57
hearing for this application um I'll accept a motion motion motion by Lyn
1:42:04
second second by Karen all in favor I I all right uh you may remember such films
1:42:10
that no good evening Taylor Palmer with cud and fader on behalf of the applicant tonight I'm joined by Chris raphaeli our architect not the cookie cutter one from
1:42:16
the previous application uh and the engineer Mike bodendorf of Hudson Land Design uh our traffic Park Consultants
1:42:22
are Phil Gill and Rich D Anda from cers and Phil is joining us this evening uh as Jennifer and the chairman mentioned we are before you this evening in
1:42:28
connection with our public hearing uh this is for a lot merger and site plan approval application uh proposing to
1:42:33
merge the three lots that comprise the property an adap will be reused the existing building for a proposed mixed
1:42:38
use development which includes a Duncan coffee house with accessory drive-through additional first floor
1:42:43
commercial space uh and residential units on the second floor uh for the record uh as this is a
1:42:49
public hearing notice and signage uh as well as the associated mailings for publication were completed pursuant to
1:42:54
the zoning requirements uh with proof of same uh supplied to uh Mercedes uh as our first public hearing
1:43:01
if I may for the benefit of the members of the public that are joining us this evening I'll provide a summary of the property uh and the project that's
1:43:07
before the board uh on for hearing tonight as is detailed in our submissions to the board uh we are again
1:43:12
proposing to adaptively reuse uh the existing building on the property which uh many uh recall as being the Healey
1:43:18
Ford car dealership an active uh car dealership on the property currently the premises is improved by an existing
1:43:24
one-story uh and partial two-story building uh and Associated off street parking areas the property is presently
1:43:30
classified in the GB General business district uh and it abuts property in the city's LI or light industrial excuse me
1:43:37
hi heavy industrial not light industrial zoning district and the property is not in the city's HD uh the surrounding area
1:43:44
includes a mix of industrial commercial as well as residential uses including a gas station a laundromat uh restaurants
1:43:51
Professional Service offices or repair uh automobile repair uh and two former car dealerships that are being re
1:43:57
rehabilitated uh at this time into a carvana car dealership as well as a single uh excuse me as well as a place
1:44:03
of worship the applicant again is proposing to reuse the portions of the existing building uh as the Duncan coffee house
1:44:10
with the accessory drive-through the Duncan Coffee House and accessory drive-through will be located within the northern portion uh of the first floor
1:44:18
of the building the accessory driveth through will be located behind the building consisting of menu ordering board uh on the Southeastern corner of
1:44:24
the building and a pickup window uh there we have uh significant queuing
1:44:30
space as well for any uh queuing of vehicles again which Mr uh gy will touch on during his
1:44:35
presentation um for those of you keeping track at home uh this Duncan coffee
1:44:41
house is being proposed directly across effectively directly across the street uh from where uh the former Duncan uh
1:44:47
without drive-through was located uh essentially across from town next to Townsend should also be noted as I'm
1:44:53
sure many of you experienced Duncan utilizes and heavily relies on the accessory drive-through service and mobile ordering to provide for its
1:44:59
customers uh there are numerous letters of support uh that were received from the community that highlight their
1:45:04
support with this application uh some noting uh the convenience the affordability uh as well as the job
1:45:10
creation among others uh that the project in particular the Duncan drive-thru and its use will bring to
1:45:15
this uh quor um we've noted this in previous applications but for you for
1:45:20
purposes of of the application itself dunan has been using mobile ordering applications for over a decade
1:45:26
recognizing its Patron's Reliance on uh the mobile ordering uh and its growing
1:45:31
utilization for phone applications and pre-ordering and mechanisms all to help uh keep things flowing uh smoothly
1:45:37
through the drive-thru and again A P dominance of coffee is is actually distributed I I prefer the egg and cheese but that's me the project aligns
1:45:44
uh with the permitted uses in the district and the goals that we understood that the fisal Avenue committee was considering the APPA
1:45:50
employed a number uh of uh proposed sit improvements that are in line with these faac committee uh recommendations
1:45:56
designed to enhance The Pedestrian experience and support bicycle Transportation within that quarter uh
1:46:01
some of those just that uh will be I think more specifically spelled out in the site plan review uh include curbing
1:46:06
along fishal Avenue to Define two specific entry points off of uh fiscal Avenue where the current Frontage is the
1:46:12
whole site uh where it's fully paved uh and has no defined driveway locations as
1:46:18
present we're including a 13t trademarked land banked sidewalk walk area along the frontage of the building
1:46:25
excuse me Frontage of the property that would provide for pedestrian Andor bicycle access facilities uh that may be
1:46:30
recommended by the committee so an open sort of book to when the committee decides what It ultimately looks to have
1:46:36
there um this project would Implement that rather than sort of do the same work twice we included a pedestrian uh
1:46:42
crosswalk and two rapid uh solar excuse me solar Flashing LED blinker signs uh
1:46:47
at the intersection of Townsend and Fishkill Avenue along with crosswalk ahead signs and Fishkill Avenue 200 feet
1:46:53
advance of this crosswalk so we've included new pedestrian access movements again sort of emphasizing The Pedestrian
1:46:58
friendliness of this site certainly compared to what is existing condition today a bicycle rack and benches are
