1:47:04
also proposed on the site the brick facade changes are significant to the existing uh facility you'll see uh
1:47:09
during the presentation some side by sides of existing versus proposed proposed conditions uh we have
1:47:15
substantial thank you uh Mr raphaeli or whoever is controlling the system at home uh there's substantial landscaping
1:47:22
and patio along uh the property which has been expanded based on comments uh from the Consultants uh as the project
1:47:28
has gone along very much and very importantly uh we do have a proposed access easement uh effectively a walking
1:47:35
path between the Fishkill Avenue and the future Greenway uh Trail or the rail trail Heritage Trail whatever it may
1:47:41
become uh known as whatever Acron will give it then um but that would be the first connection uh along this section
1:47:46
so that's that's certainly proposed here which is just an Adaptive reuse project uh and ALS ultimately we also discussed
1:47:52
about a parking area for shared use with the laundr map where currently it kind of parks into the city's RightWay so we're helping to try and alleviate
1:47:58
additional kits not even on our site so at the end of the day this is an Adaptive reuse of an existing building that's already constructed uh and the
1:48:04
whole site today is mostly impious Services which the applicant is working to improve through uh the implementation
1:48:10
of some green space areas landscaping and Patio uh and connection um with that I will turn to uh I think I'll go to go
1:48:17
to you first Chris you want to go to Mr Bor yeah all right I'll have Mr rafaeli the architect speak to uh our site plan
1:48:24
and I should note that this is also a type two action under
1:48:33
Seeker uh good evening Chris Raphael with Studio architecture uh so last month we kind of focused on maybe the
1:48:39
stair Tower a bit in its design and adjusting the windows some brick relief
1:48:45
and design so we've adjusted the tower uh We've lowered the overall height from
1:48:51
what it was last time introduced a larger piece of glass in the front eliminated that clock um I don't know
1:48:58
can you zoom in on that a little
1:49:05
bit yeah yeah that's perfect thank you yeah
1:49:11
um so we've we've introduced some um
1:49:16
brick detailing in where the uh wones are the corners of the building some
1:49:23
relief at the top to help to find the the uh parit over over the glass um
1:49:31
that's essentially the changes anything
1:49:37
else thanks okay
1:49:46
[Music]
1:49:53
good evening Mike Bowen dorf INF for Dan kler tonight I'll do my best impression of him um just to uh touch on a few
1:50:00
things that Taylor spoke about um you know the site as it currently exists is sort of a big open cut along fish kill
1:50:08
Avenue so we're adding curbing here and only two points of Ingress egress so it
1:50:13
changes an existing condition of a free-for-all to channelized Ingress egress um we're reducing the impervious
1:50:21
Surface by 20 % um providing as Taylor mentioned
1:50:26
several pedestrian friendly amenities walkways the front Plaza the crosswalk across fish Avenue sidewalk connection
1:50:34
future rail trail connection a pocket park and the 13ft reserve zone for the future fish kill lab advisory committee
1:50:41
pedestrian plants um we're proposing a fully parking compliant plan with adequate
1:50:48
internal circulation um lighting is Led full cut off dark sky compliant fixtures
1:50:54
consisting of all new light poles there if anybody knows the site there's some very large light poles with very bright
1:51:01
spotlights on there now they're all being replaced with with uh with new technology
1:51:08
um the site will utilize uh new water and sewer connections to the existing
1:51:13
infrastructure in uh fish kill Avenue and just some key site plan changes
1:51:19
since the last time we saw you um the South entrance entrance has been changed
1:51:26
back to deliveries only um we've uh we're showing some
1:51:32
stamp uh pavement there to sort of deter customers from using that as a cut
1:51:38
through um and there's also proposed signage there the four previous parallel
1:51:44
spaces for tenants have been taking out of this and this is now back to a
1:51:49
loading area and the four tenant spaces have been moved to the north side of the site uh one additional space has been
1:51:56
added to the north side of the building here and one additional space has been added to the spaces that are adjacent to
1:52:02
the the laundry um since the last submission we provided grading and utility plan
1:52:09
consisting of water sewer storm water and a detailed Landscaping plan
1:52:15
has been provided in addition there's been uh several on-site signage
1:52:21
directional signage and as Taylor mentioned in the offsite uh crosswalk signage that's generally it in a
1:52:28
nutshell if anybody has any questions I'm happy to answer them thank
1:52:39
you prep uh good evening again Philip gy from kao's engineering and design we
1:52:46
prepar the uh parking and traffic study uh most of the details in terms of the
1:52:51
access have already been covered uh pointing out again that the southern driveway is for deliveries only uh We've
1:53:00
concentrated the access uh uh so that it aligns with the exit from the uh
1:53:07
drive-thru and the traffic study was very conservative in terms of not taking
1:53:12
any credit for what we call passby trips with this type of coffee house you would
1:53:19
typically get somewhere between 40 and 50% of those trips being traffic that's already on the
1:53:25
roadway our analysis did not take any credit for that uh in terms of the
1:53:31
parking uh we meet the code compliant we had done parking estimates
1:53:38
based on the it trip generation and parking generation information and uh
1:53:46
the plan meets uh what the peak demand would be for the site uh we've gone
1:53:53
through some of the off-site improvements making accommodations for pedestrian movements the signing and the
1:54:00
uh flashing uh signs uh would be part of our site plan uh work that would be done
1:54:09
that's uh pretty much it any questions i' be happy to answer um uh I have a question about the
1:54:16
southern entrance that's the delivery yes what um mechanisms do you uh are you
1:54:22
going to use just to like control the actual use so it would be
1:54:28
assigning um The Proposal right now is to have uh a different textured uh
1:54:35
surface so it doesn't look like a driveway uh we could go to even a a
1:54:40
mountable curb so that you know TP you would it wouldn't appear as a curb cut
1:54:45
but a delivery vehicle could enter at that point uh but primarily signing and
1:54:51
differen the treatment that's
1:54:59
there okay thank you thank
1:55:08
you okay that's your presentation if I may Mr chairman just one other comment I did sort of note it in the uh the
1:55:15
presentation but there are uh we did submit an additional letter to you all uh that included letters of support from
1:55:21
uh the business businesses and a buding and joining Property Owners uh throughout the area and there are a
1:55:26
number of positive letters uh received today uh that were or or that have been posted by Mercedes to the uh the city's
1:55:33
website today in support of the application noted all the letters um have been received and entered into the
1:55:40
record um thank you so then we'll um make our way around the um the table
1:55:46
with our Consultants first and then um any other questions or observations by
1:55:51
the board and then we'll go to the public so this we'll go in sort of opposite order anything you have to add
1:55:59
as part of your review certainly Ken wored uh Craton Manning the traffic consultant to the planning board I had
1:56:04
one question about the flashing beacons for the pedestrians if those were push button activated or they're just on 24
1:56:11
hours a day the proposal is for uh fully
1:56:19
operating no not actuated just to identify the crosswalk area okay but
1:56:25
that could be modified if the board would like and I had mentioned it in previous review but I know the city is
1:56:31
looking has a committee looking at that whole Corridor so I appreciate the offer
1:56:37
of the flashing beacons I would just ask that to be consistent with whatever is determined as the best option you
1:56:43
through there thank you thank you thank you gosh it's so much easier to hear you when you're
1:56:51
here John Mr Russo so Mike I heard you say that the
1:56:57
impervious was being reduced by 20% I need you to verify that cuz under
1:57:02
the new storm water General permit it's got to be 25 cent or
1:57:09
25% or better for re uh Redevelopment otherwise you're going to have to do
1:57:14
something else on site that's for sites that are over an acre size you're over an acre in size
1:57:23
[Music] so call call
1:57:30
Dan um so take a look into that let's see where you are um we're looking for
1:57:37
some additional grading in the area where they're going to be providing the easement for the trail to run through
1:57:43
the site we' like to see that rough graded out now at this time so later on it wouldn't have to be graded
1:57:49
out um and then we just have a number of cleanup items that need to be done um as
1:57:57
far as some of the Landscaping it overpowers everything on the plans you can't even read some of the
1:58:02
text um we'd like we'd like to have some well I don't want the Landscaping
1:58:09
eliminated I just want it lightened up so we can read the plants um spot elevations along the
1:58:15
curbed islands and everything so that we know how the site's being properly graded um
1:58:22
and that's basically it at this point in time great thank you
1:58:27
John Natalie uh Natalie Quinn KRC planning Consultants so a a number of
1:58:34
the previous comments I think have been addressed so just to kind of acknowledge that in terms of the request for the
1:58:40
crossing um um loading area I I guess I do want
1:58:46
to go back to the one comment because what we're seeing here is kind of a reversion of the site plan we we saw a different version where um I think a
1:58:53
previous request of mine was to locate the resident there are three residential units on this site so to locate that
1:58:58
parking uh closer to where the access point for those will be um so that's what we saw last month and I think
1:59:05
ultimately we reverted back to this site plan um I just want to say I did
1:59:11
consider the you know the option of recommending that the the front parking there was originally parking between the
1:59:17
building and the and the drive the drive-thru Lane um that would be the
1:59:22
parking closest to the residential entrance so I was kind of thinking about that as a potential solution here I
1:59:28
think ultimately the move that has been made of providing um additional Landscaping additional kind of
1:59:33
pedestrian space in front of that building and limiting the amount of uh kind of asphalt uh between the between
1:59:40
the road I think is the ultimately the better move there in terms of kind of trying to create a sense that this
1:59:47
building is kind of up to the street Edge so I just want to note that that consideration was made and I think um
1:59:54
ultimately moving the parking although it is further away from the residential entrance um moving it further away and
1:59:59
having those pedestrian connections does seem to be uh the the better solution than what we've seen um in terms of the
2:00:05
other option I'm just curious that I'm at least the drawing I'm looking at they're not designated they may be
2:00:11
designated elsewhere it's they're back over um between kind of right between the two
2:00:18
pedestrian points Mike's highlighting it on the screen oh thanks M the note is is
2:00:24
on the open space Oh okay so you kind of I know you kind of miss it the crosswalk was move the the passage or the
2:00:30
crosswalk there internal was moved to try and the spaces were sort of teed up to be with that internal Crossing yeah
2:00:38
um so you know I think there have been changes to address some of my previous comments so the one remaining comment we
2:00:44
did just get the the lighting plan and I think they have um added notes about it being
2:00:50
compliant I think my last last request was because we're doing mix use on this site right so there is going to be this
2:00:57
active Commercial Business retail business um and then residential units um I my
2:01:04
one question was whether dimming or some kind of reduction of lighting in the evening hours when the when the Duncan
2:01:11
is closed um to create more of a residential environment on this site
2:01:16
whether that was possible um so I think that's my last remaining comment to discuss that and
2:01:22
um how the applicant maybe feels that's being addressed already um otherwise if it's possible to add some kind of I
2:01:29
don't know portion of the lights turning off maybe a a you know some kind of solution so that the residents living on
2:01:35
the site don't feel like they're living in the middle of a parking lot or commercial space 247 I'll mik speak to
2:01:42
that but yes we're amable to that okay yeah in fact some of your that's a great suggestion some of your highest lighting
2:01:48
levels are around that side of the building you got 0.9 1.0 right up against that
2:01:56
residential piece yeah Mr Bondo yeah I I think what we can
2:02:02
do is I I wouldn't want to dim it in the
2:02:08
residential parking area just because it's residents they they could come at any time of the night so I want to keep
2:02:13
those and we're looking at mostly half foot candle levels in there yeah but I think we could dim the lights along
2:02:20
Fishkill Avenue we probably dim the lights around the back of the building cuz that's all commercial use back there yeah we think I was at least I was
2:02:27
highlighting this area here but yeah along the front as well yeah it'd be a
2:02:33
nice we can certainly do that nice gesture thank you yeah I think all a big
2:02:38
upgrade from the existing tall spotlights too yep thank
2:02:46
you any questions or other comments for the applicant board
2:02:53
I just have a question about the uh conservation advisory committee recommendations and how we incorporate
2:03:00
that into the process you're asking that of
2:03:06
me yes oh I don't know so let's talk to
2:03:11
uh Jennifer about that I I think yeah the cic does offer
2:03:17
and if I missed it did they share their observations here yeah yeah so the CAC
2:03:25
did submit comments to the planning board on this application um just like
2:03:31
any public comment I mean obviously the CAC is a is a committee of the city um but that's for you to review and take
2:03:37
into consideration yeah so so having having reviewed it what are your
2:03:42
thoughts um my thoughts were that they came out uh sort of opposed to the
2:03:49
project um and seem to be asking for more time for you know planning
2:03:56
considerations regarding the carer and I'm not sure you know that's a that's a
2:04:01
mechanism that don't have a good handle on exactly how that gets coordinated but um they had a number of environmental
2:04:07
concerns about vehicle exhaust um from idling vehicles
2:04:13
um so and and I think the one my takeaway from reading it was that the
2:04:19
they felt like there was a not enough that they needed more time to kind of plan out rail trail and bicycle access
2:04:27
options and that this was uh you know I think it I mean I certainly have
2:04:33
felt I kind of sense that um Community efforts to plan around this Carter are
2:04:39
sort of in a race against the clock with projects yeah again I think it we'll go
2:04:45
back to um what Jennifer outlined for us at the very beginning here we we need to review this based on the zoning at as is
2:04:53
that's in place currently uh obviously everybody understands that there's an effort
2:04:59
um in progress in reviewing this Corridor but it's it hasn't even reached the level of
2:05:07
um in the absence of a moratorium we can't halt or or
2:05:14
um you know or or wait for you know planning considerations to catch up for
2:05:21
the Cor I we have to continue reviewing the application a follow on question would just be really quick one thing
2:05:27
would be who were the various parties who could recommend a moratorium city council it's a
2:05:32
legislative matter for the city council yeah I mean it one of the things I see when I looked over this letter as well
2:05:39
as some various some of the other comments is simply
2:05:46
um you know the view that we should or should not have drive-throughs or that
2:05:53
we do or do not like Duncan Donuts Visa V other sellers of copy and baked goods
2:06:02
um are not really but not really are not pertinent considerations for us up here
2:06:09
the point where definitely not material to give a specific example if we were up here talking about how much we hate
2:06:14
Dunkin Donuts and then wound up denying site plan approval we' really just be setting the city up for lossy
2:06:20
potentially full disclosure I buy ducking coffee me too and patronize yeah so I I
2:06:28
do note in reading this is also this letter is also directed to the city council um with specific recommendations
2:06:34
so that was my comment I'm sorry that the the actual letter itself was to all
2:06:40
the it was to all it was to all the boards including the city council and again it's it's directing recommendations specifically to the city
2:06:47
council so it's it's on that path City Council receipt
2:06:54
um go ahead I'm sorry finish I I thought you were done no no no please thank you
2:07:00
uh the only other comment I had was just to kind of echo some of the logistical and safety concerns for residents um I
2:07:07
know we I had asked a couple meetings ago about has Duncan done other residential developments in concert with
2:07:14
retail establishments we were told that they have I just keep trying to figure out U myself bringing in many trips of
2:07:21
groc groceries or doing move in or move out and making multiple trips across that um crosswalk with a sort of Wagon
2:07:28
Train of drive-thru cars going around it um it it just seems it
2:07:36
seems yeah um I was just saying that I I keep envisioning myself trying to do
2:07:41
everyday tasks at this site as a potential resident and imagining things like making multiple trips from the car
2:07:48
with my groceries to my apartment or doing move in and move out carrying couch down that lengthy pedestrian
2:07:54
crosswalk with a sort of Wagon Train of cars circling through the drive-thru it just it seems complicated and I I
2:08:01
understand the constraints about where to put the resident parking but it is a head scratcher for me we did just if I may just to that specific comment we did
2:08:07
include a loading zone on the other side of the building and not withstanding the use here this is an existing building we're not moving the building or
2:08:12
changing the location so the operations through the site would continue to have vehicles notwithstanding a drive-thru
2:08:17
circulating the site so I think ultimately your points are well taken but the site has incorporated a number
2:08:23
of other measures utilizing our traffic and safety consultant and reviewing it yeah look the way the way I look at this is that um residential is it's improve
2:08:30
use here um so you're allowed to you're allowed to put Apartments uh on this
2:08:37
site whether at the end of the day and of course you're required to you know Implement as as as best you uh can uh
2:08:45
all safety considerations right which you've done uh so at the end of the day
2:08:51
it's a matter of whether you know the applicant um feels that they can reasonably lease these to people who
2:08:57
might want to you know carry their couch across the parking lot just emphasizing that whatever Creative Solutions can be
2:09:04
done to make it as safe as possible for the residents are recommended appreciate that thank you
2:09:11
okay uh so if there's not anything else Kevin David I think it's an excellent
2:09:17
report I just want to uh uh I would like to see more um more input from uh uh
2:09:27
interested parties or from our our also from Consultants that's based
2:09:32
upon uh uh this kind of this level of research right and also the level of uh
2:09:38
public interest um uh based in public interest that that it uh has so I think
2:09:44
it's it's it's something this this report should be taken seriously I think it has we're Limited
2:09:52
by the situation that we're in as to what we can uh
2:09:57
uh uh what we can expect to the applicant right because of the existing laws and existing uh as of right uh
2:10:04
things but I think that uh we have a responsibility once we're more informed
2:10:10
to ask number one the uh uh that this uh
2:10:15
perform at a higher level there's another thing that I just want to this is a general eneral comment
2:10:21
about the process that's happening in the city is that
2:10:27
um uh I think that right now the that exist that land
2:10:34
use at at Fishkill Avenue is not the best way to develop cities right it's an
2:10:40
autom Centric use there's a lot of reasons why uh the city should consider
2:10:45
not encouraging that sort of Land Development it's uh you know as
2:10:51
environmental benefits it's not beneficial to people it's not pleasant uh there higher land uses there's better
2:10:58
ways to develop cities now and areas like that that being said there's an
2:11:03
existing fabric that's in place and uh almost all of the buildings in
2:11:10
the fabric that are now abandoned are probably going to be applied to be uh uh
2:11:18
remain in place and be reused in some way um those leases will go on for a
2:11:24
certain period of time the that period of time is the time that I think the city should in my opinion consider um a
2:11:34
more uh Visionary uh change in the way that that
2:11:39
land is uh used the way that uh we enter into the City and that uh we uh uh uh
2:11:48
take advantage of an opportunity to be a uh uh an example for how U uh we can do
2:11:57
land use uh planning better in our cities thank you for that comment and
2:12:04
just if I may I mean this is a transformative project for the site we're talking about a car dealership that's been there for 40 years so the
2:12:09
project is proposing a number of those Fishkill Avenue committee recommendations and trying to manage and
2:12:14
mitigate and consider all of those moving pieces while ultimately having a property that has been used in one way
2:12:21
for decades uh this is a huge advancement of that site Greening up the space providing connections to the rail
2:12:27
trail providing a crosswalk it's implementing a number of measures over the existing conditions which is a wide open parking area with access anywhere
2:12:34
off a fishal Avenue we're even going so far as to mitigating and milting problems of an adjoining property owner
2:12:39
for the for the uh the laundromat so this site plan has really taken a huge uh jump and and and work with the board
2:12:46
to to get it into this current iteration um we look forward to hopefully being able to bring it uh to the site with
2:12:51
that though I'll certainly um turn to the chairman to see if there are any other comments before we open to the public no let's go to the public uh who
2:12:59
here would like to speak on this application great um
2:13:06
please yeah we'll go front to
2:13:14
back good evening um thank you for bringing up conservation advisory committee Sergey kov chair conservation
2:13:21
committee so um we did submit the comments and I wanted to vocalize some of them I fully recognize uh that
2:13:28
planning board has to deal and work within the current zoning regulations
2:13:33
but uh we felt that some of these considerations should be aired and shared with the broader public um
2:13:42
conservation advisor committee that I chair strongly opposes the proposed drive-through facility at 42043 Fishkill
2:13:48
Avenue The Proposal comes at a critical Junction in our community when our community is actively engaged in
2:13:54
reimagining this former carders ship area through citizen committee process the proposed drive-thru would
2:14:00
effectively pre-end this community-driven planning effort and potentially undermine the emerging V
2:14:06
vision for really walkable and mixed use District that better serves our community uh into the future CC
2:14:14
therefore strongly supports recommendations by Fishkill Avenue concept committee to prohibit drive-throughs used at this ation and
2:14:22
throughout the city our position is based on the following concerns both that are s specific and more General
2:14:29
impacts uh first is significant safety and traffic hazards uh according to Federal Highway Administration
2:14:36
research uh each additional driveway access point increases pedestrian vehicle conflict potentially by 11
2:14:43
15% uh the previous uh usage didn't involve high volume of traffic uh living
2:14:48
and entering the facility current proposed usage would have constant flow
2:14:54
of traffic uh and the potential for accidents therefore goes up uh the
2:15:00
absence of a dedicated turn lane on fish kill Avenue presents uh very uh serious safety concern according to Department
2:15:07
of Transportation um lack of left turns can increase accidents up to 30% or even
2:15:15
more um those of us who know this area um it's uh very busy you have cars going
2:15:24
you know especially morning afternoon people going to work making a left turn into the driveway to enter the Dunkin
2:15:30
Donuts while trying to cut in front of incoming traffic um you might not notice
2:15:36
a child on a bicycle it just it's a high pressure situation for drivers uh which impose uh imposes danger upon pedestrian
2:15:44
and uh bicycle users um this also uh presents a
2:15:50
fundamental conflict with the climate action goals that our city has Set uh this car Centric development promotes
2:15:57
car dependence at a time when our community is trying to imagine
2:16:02
um time when we have L driving uh this also directly contradicts several of
2:16:08
bacon established environmental commitments as well as um the New York
2:16:14
City climate uh act which explicitly mandates adoption of non-vehicular Mobility oriented strategic uh
2:16:21
strategies for greenhouse gas mitigation Public Health environment impacts uh
2:16:27
multiple peer-reviewed Studies have demonstrated significant health risks from emissions uh studies of children
2:16:33
living near high traffic areas show significant increase risk of asthma and respiratory diseases and the proposed
2:16:40
queuing of 12 idling vehicles for several hours a day would create concentrated source of air pollution in
2:16:47
our community Gateway development 20 17 comprehensive plan emphasizes creating
2:16:54
welcoming Transit oriented gateways that reflect uh Bon's Community Center
2:17:00
Centric uh development doesn't really fit square with that vision of welcoming
2:17:06
community and uh uh it also fails to capitalize fully on the site's potential
2:17:12
to create positive lens synergies with rail trail and surrounding neighborhood
2:17:17
development uh additionally economic and community impacts um comparative Studies
2:17:23
have demonstrate the significant economic disadvantages of drivethru developments um according to the data
2:17:31
from brainer Minnesota people oriented development generates uh
2:17:36
41% higher property value than drive-throughs establishments occupying the same square footage and the reduced
2:17:43
property valuation directly impacts uh tax revenues um also very likely it will
2:17:50
discourage future pedestrian oriented businesses from locating in adjacent properties uh creating dampening effect
2:17:58
on overall District property values so given the ongoing Community visioning process for this area
2:18:04
approving a low value drive-thru use would represent a significant opportunity cost both for tax revenue
2:18:11
and broader Economic Development goals um now I want to switch gears and
2:18:19
present comments as the resident of w three who lives directly across from um
2:18:27
uh the proposed development uh I live in Liberty Street w three I can see the
2:18:32
back of the building uh from my backyard and uh uh that area is very
2:18:38
special for us uh for our neighborhood it's area that we walk uh and um you
2:18:43
know the car dealership was obviously not the most welcoming the community process that started uh gave us hope of
2:18:51
envisioning real Community Centric opportunities there um I think this
2:18:56
development is shortsighted uh they do not really uh it doesn't account for the
2:19:03
volume of pedestrian and bicycle traffic you will see there once rail trail is
2:19:08
built once Greenway Trail is extended when Bridge Street bridge is repaired
2:19:14
and fully open to connect kind of the uh east side to the west side ac across
2:19:20
fish Creek there will be very high volume of pedestrian traffic especially if more uh
2:19:26
pedestrian oriented businesses open Crossing that uh inout uh uh cut for the vehicle to come
2:19:34
in will create a lot of potential for accidents as I stated earlier lack of uh
2:19:41
left turning uh Lane and the rush for the drivers to
2:19:46
enter um three proposed Apartments I think is a disgrace while I fully
2:19:52
support uh housing and trying ways to build more housing imagine an apartment
2:19:58
surrounded by cars idling cars around you know you cannot open your window you
2:20:04
know it's asthma it's it just it's you know I'm not really livable
2:20:10
situation um again 200 uh 2017 comprehensive plan
2:20:18
I want to restate that as a resident uh you know we do want that walkable uh pedestrian oriented
2:20:26
developments um and we do want uh I do want real economic opportunities
2:20:31
unfortunately uh places like uh uh Dunkin Donuts tend to pay minimal wage
2:20:37
and um we can probably do better in our community thank you thank you next
2:20:59
[Music] hi my name is Stuart wetherby I live on
2:21:05
66 meet Avenue I have lived at that address for over 30 years I'm against
2:21:11
the application because it includes a drive-thru with plans on the way to make
2:21:16
that Corridor Less Car Centric and more pedestrian and bike friendly
2:21:21
it seems to me like a bad idea I am worried about traffic idling
2:21:27
cars garbage up and down Fishkill Avenue and how it will fit into the newly
2:21:32
forming District although it meets the legal definition of a coffee house because 60%
2:21:41
of their revenue will be coffee sales they will also be selling
2:21:46
food my concern is that the drive-through element will make it more like a fast food restaurant and not like
2:21:53
any coffee house we have here in Beacon now I have been to a dunan drive-thru
2:22:01
they have a similar setup to a fast food restaurant the coffee shop with retail
2:22:08
and rental space above I think is a good idea it is the drive-thru I disagree
2:22:16
with and lastly I would like to say that when we bought our house over 30 years
2:22:22
ago our friends thought we were crazy who wants to buy a new house in an old
2:22:28
run down Beacon they said but look at us now we are the Envy of the Hudson Valley
2:22:35
no small feet and something we can all be proud of although the focus of Beacon's
2:22:41
rebirth hasn't been the Fishkill Avenue Corridor it seems to be now Beacon
2:22:48
deserves and should demand very best and in my opinion allowing a drive-thru
2:22:55
would lower not raise that bar thank you thank [Music]
2:23:03
you
2:23:10
next sorry I'm opposed to the scale of this project and do not believe it
2:23:15
should be granted a site plan and lot merger approval the agenda calls it a
2:23:20
subdivision yet it was referenced as a lot merger most of the letters of support mentioned by legal
2:23:26
Representatives tonight some of them are from other um current and future applicants with pending development
2:23:32
projects in the mix I find it ironic that the city of Beacon is pushing to have an extensive rail trail along the
2:23:38
Fishkill Creek yet you're being asked to allow this branded corporate project to move in and infringe on the beauty of
2:23:44
the fisho creek and the residential areas please do not approve a drive-through window with traffic going
2:23:51
behind the rear of the building potential gas fumes oil and gas spills can run off into the creek night sky
2:23:57
compliant lighting is okay but not to the residents that live below the lights I also live on the other side of the
2:24:04
creek uh these lights will be intrusive I was happy to hear the city planner request tonight that the lights be
2:24:10
turned off or the volume reduced during the nighttime closed business hours I I
2:24:15
live across the creek within sight of this proposed project and believe this will be an eyesore visually and bring in
2:24:21
extra noise pollution from the constant traffic noise travels so we we will hear those cars coming and going and doors
2:24:28
closing and the delivery trucks will be very busy yes I know it was a car dealer for years but it did not have the large
2:24:34
number of traffic volume of customers and was not open late into the night support our community and not the big
2:24:40
corporations they will not be offering too many jobs in this to this community please support the city council's
2:24:46
pending resolution for the Route 52 Corridor zoning changes thank thank
2:24:54
you anyone else yes
2:25:08
please hi I'm Katie helmouth W one uh firstly regarding the resoning that the
2:25:15
city council is considering I am in favor of keeping zoning as is to allow all auto business is to remain as well
2:25:21
as storage facilities to not amend the zoning to Zone Out Auto uses and storage facility uses as a mother of three
2:25:28
children and a daughter of an aging parent who cannot walk well and a friend Elders who cannot walk well I am in
2:25:34
favor of drive-throughs in Beacon in general and the drive-thru for the proposed Dunkin Donuts I will also note
2:25:41
that I am a bike rider I ride up and down Main Street often to get to where I need to go so I am in favor of
2:25:47
accessible and safe bike riding while I'm also practical with my family needs when I can and cannot ride a bike and
2:25:54
need my car for people driving to do errands or commute to work early in the morning this is a convenient addition to
2:26:01
Beacon many of us already go to Dunkin Donuts on Route 9 on the way to wers or pipy kids are often requesting to go to
2:26:09
Dunkin Donuts as a person doing laundry I would love access to Dunkin Donuts while washing I was surprised to read in
2:26:16
tonight's documents that several people wrote in with their support of drive-thru and Dunkin Donuts as for the
2:26:23
proposed crosswalk I cannot believe there hasn't been a crosswalk like this put on to 52 already this is a welcome
2:26:30
addition as a franchise business this seems this means that a small business owner has invested in the location
2:26:37
building and employees this is a benefit to our community franchises are at times
2:26:42
looked down upon in small towns even though Beacon is a city however many forget that franchises are owned by
2:26:49
local business owners Subway for example on Main Street in Beacon is owned by a woman named Joy who takes great pride in
2:26:55
her business additionally I wonder what the response would be if a local raster wanted to open a drive-thru here like
2:27:02
the Hudson Valley based ready coffee that has a drive-thru up on 90m pyy as
2:27:08
for competition with other coffee shops in Beacon I do not think this will be a problem the coffee shops that exist here
2:27:14
now have been in business for a bit and are surviving some coffee shop owners have three locations like two traes and
2:27:21
one Bank Square which are each owned by the same people each coffee shop has its own environment feeling and experience
2:27:28
one going to Dunkin Donuts is going there for a certain reason that day that would be different than when they were
2:27:34
going to the Cozier Beacon Mercantile on a different day as for doughnut competition with other two dut shops in
2:27:41
Beacon again these are wildly different donuts and donut purchasing experiences
2:27:46
so I do not see this as a problem kids often love Dunkin Donuts as the committee is looking to increase the
2:27:52
vibrancy of the fish kill Corridor having this accessible and desirable by kids and teenagers seems compatible the
2:27:59
drive-through design seems safe driving through a coffee snack or food pickup AIDS in the parking issue as it does not
2:28:06
require as much parking it's fluid as for the residential apartments above I
2:28:12
think it should be left up to the person renting or buying that spot that space up there to make the decision if they
2:28:17
want to live above a commercial space like Dunkin Donuts these are not the only apartments that exist above Dunkin Donuts or other
2:28:24
coffee shops in general thank you thank
2:28:29
you anyone
2:28:36
else okay did you have something you wanted to
2:28:41
add it's a loaded question um not this evening Mr chairman we will certainly
2:28:47
provide some written responses to those uh comments for the benefit of the board okay yes and again um we will note in
2:28:54
addition to the comments here this evening we did receive a number of um letters as well um and those are
2:29:02
in the record um board thoughts uh on where we are with the public
2:29:08
hearing any um discussion around potential
2:29:15
close thoughts in favor have outstanding lighting plan uh um lighting spin's there we just
2:29:22
have to adjust potentially adjust the lighting yeah they do have a detailed plan with levels are you know in
2:29:28
compliance it really was this discussion about the ability to dim and so um yeah
2:29:36
I I think just as far as the application completeness at this point um there
2:29:41
aren't many outstanding items yeah I was just going to say when the lighting note is added to the plan the hours of
2:29:48
operation just I I assume it would be done at the same time as the lighting when you're indicating when it will be dimmed but um but yeah I had no other
2:29:57
comments in terms of the completeness of the materials thank you we wrapped up from an perspective I believe we are
2:30:03
yeah unless you have other comments you want to make on the architecture uh no it's an improvement I
2:30:09
you know I'd want if I have an opportunity uh on the site plan um the um there's a pedestrian cost uh The
2:30:16
Pedestrian access from the parking to the building yes there's a long walkway
2:30:23
and I'm not sure if it was there before if that changed location yeah only thing that it did was shift slightly we added
2:30:28
so you'll see where it connects to The Greenway Trail connection so there's a connection point with the trail connection but then the it that that so
2:30:34
it has been there it just was shifted and then we located the resident parking to sort of associate with that as well I
2:30:40
was curious why it just it didn't just shift to where the bump outs were farther into the site where there's a
2:30:46
smaller distance for the walkways I think it actually had been there originally it's just it's just a
2:30:53
seemed like it was a safer shorter um crosswalk I think It
2:30:59
ultimately it was just lined up with where the handicapped parking spaces are too so it kind of gives like a Runway there but we're certainly open to those
2:31:06
suggestions but nothing you know again it was line that way for where it connected with the trail and sort of the
2:31:11
center of the okay commercial entrance suggestion as far as the layout of the
2:31:16
site it seemed like you would I think it translates the entrance of the of the commercial
2:31:22
space did you have someone have thoughts yeah just a comment on that um I think
2:31:28
you're describing it moving further down on the on the page to where it lands on one of those islands and the aisles that
2:31:34
you're Crossing are much shorter MH uh my only concern with that is are people going to walk out of their way and use
2:31:41
it to come back to kind of the front of the store I think where it's located right now it's
2:31:47
more uh likely to be used because it's closer to where you're getting out of your car and and landing on it um so yes
2:31:56
you're you're Crossing you know two AIS you're going in between cars that are parked uh but you're only at worst four
2:32:03
spaces away from getting to that uh that crosswalk okay Lane so to speak I it
2:32:09
just you know that's rational and it's intended to be striped
2:32:15
right yes yeah so it's quite visible quite clear I I just a quick question
2:32:20
it's a minor detail but up at the um I don't know if you want to if you can zoom in but up at the um Ingress eress
2:32:27
the main entry point there's a there's some indication of and it may just be a leftover on the
2:32:35
drawing um he's playing with the mouse it looks like it looks like
2:32:43
striping it's a Stop Bar ohing what is that start movements truck
2:32:51
turning movements for those keeping track at home garbage trucks garbage trucks
2:32:56
turn being able to turn right on to fish kill I don't so explain how that works where all right come
2:33:02
up yeah you don't want to the echo translating for me um you're
2:33:10
talking about the striping right here yeah so that's for um for larger vehicles to effectively turn right um
2:33:18
it's based on a truck turning diagram that was run through the site and it was
2:33:23
just decided it would be best to open that up a little so that they don't have to drive up onto the curb so so it's
2:33:31
it's part of the it's it's just part of the roadway right meaning it's not a it's not a curved Element no it's just
2:33:38
striped it's just paint so the striping is intended to encourage the regular drivers to stay closer to that oh okay I
2:33:45
see could you do a mountable curb there instead of just striping sorry could you do a mountable curb
2:33:52
there instead of just striping yeah I want to defer to uh he yes he did okay yeah and similarly on the south you know
2:33:59
just to deter people from using the South um entrance
2:34:06
yeah Lor thank you appreciate that I have one question yeah um I was
2:34:13
wondering if our traffic consultant could speak to the issue that was brought up about um traffic turning left
2:34:22
into the site with uh pedestrian and bike traffic um without a left turn lane
2:34:30
is there something that we can do to mitigate that um
2:34:36
conflict there's competing users here and you know one is the is the car
2:34:42
trying to get into the site uh traffic capacity wise both for
2:34:48
the left turn vehicle coming in and for traffic just going back and forth it would be easier if there was a center
2:34:54
turn lane down through it that would benefit the road across the street it would benefit the gas station it would
2:35:01
benefit this site uh because those users can get out of the road and essentially
2:35:06
sit in the middle it's a little bit counter to The Pedestrian now they have to cross a longer distance you know to
2:35:12
go through there um obviously left turns throughout the corridor are common there
2:35:17
there really aren't any restrictions through here there are some some locations on like Route 9 and pipy
2:35:24
whoers where they've you know put a medium down the center of Route 9 because it's so large they don't want left turns Route 17 comes to mind going
2:35:32
through uh New York into New Jersey can't turn left anywere uh you know through there but those are much higher
2:35:38
facilities here um I think in the context of how the you know the the city's committee wants to look at this
2:35:45
section of Road overall um whether a third lane down the middle
2:35:51
makes sense for traffic capacity or if in doing that it takes away the ability
2:35:56
to add amenities for pedestrian and bike accommodations through that Corridor
2:36:01
obviously the RightWay is a certain width and within that uh say the width
2:36:06
of this table we can divide it up however we want but we've got to decide there's going to be pros and cons to
2:36:12
each of it so if you want to accommodate heads and bicycles we can do these accommodations it'll take away from you
2:36:19
know the AB ility for cars to make you know turns from a center lane or we can benefit them over the other so there's
2:36:25
some competition there so right there's no the conflict is kind of inherent and
2:36:31
okay yes Phil did you have anything oh we're providing that extra width there
2:36:38
to do whatever in the future needs to be done uh this section of Fishkill Avenue
2:36:44
doesn't have left turn Lanes um in some respects when you you have a lower speed
2:36:51
facility like this uh if you start adding in turn Lanes it increases traffic speeds uh in addition to
2:36:59
increasing the distance that people have to cross so it it's as Ken said it's a
2:37:05
competing uh combination of issues there but I think the plan uh in terms of
2:37:11
backups on Fishkill Avenue we have more than adequate queuing distance uh the
2:37:18
typical Peak is around 12 12 usually somewhere between 5 and 9 we can actually stack up to 16 or 17 Vehicles
2:37:26
so there won't be a spill back out onto the roadway um and we you know have designed
2:37:32
this to accommodate The Pedestrian Crossing as the kind of the key
2:37:40
variable thank you um and then the other question about The Pedestrian Crossing and the um
2:37:47
blinker sign for our traffic consultant do you recommend one that's activated by
2:37:53
The Pedestrian or um like the constantly blinking in my mind it I would seem that
2:38:01
would seem like the constantly blinking you get desensitized to um and that it
2:38:06
might be more effective to have um you know actually when someone's trying to
2:38:11
cross the street to activate the blinking that's that's my feeling as well uh you'll be driving down through
2:38:18
there at you know 10 11:00 at night you know the facility is closed it's dark
2:38:24
out people aren't using you know the future Trail and that thing is blinking um if you live on a street where you
2:38:30
come to the end of the street and you never encounter traffic because it's just a a low volume Street you tend to
2:38:35
you know Skip the stop sign and maybe just get used to driving through it um and then when that one car does come it
2:38:42
surprises you you're like whoa you know so in my opinion if if throughout the
2:38:48
section of rad um if it makes more sense to have something that is actuated so that it
2:38:55
starts blinking only when there's a pedestrian there um I think it's going to get better uh compliance relative to
2:39:01
yielding uh you know to that person and we can do whatever is consistent with
2:39:07
what the committee comes up for the corridor so we're open to
2:39:12
that thank you okay uh again we have the option of
2:39:19
closing a public hearing any thoughts on the matter or a motion to do
2:39:26
so I I guess I would ask the board do we feel like we've heard a cross-section of the views you know between the letters
2:39:32
that were submitted and the comments that were made tonight um you know go ahead and answer what do you think I
2:39:38
think we have okay there's been a lot of input yeah
2:39:45
sure so I'll accept a motion to close the public hearing motion motion by Karen seconded second by lenon all in
2:39:52
favor I I and then we have the opportunity to authorize Jen to draft uh
2:39:57
resolution on the application so um any discussion on that or is there a can I accept a
2:40:10
motion motion everybody's so quiet oh right motion by Karen second
2:40:18
second by that was Kevin Kevin all in favor thank you very much thank you
2:40:24
great so we will move to our next agenda item and well first we'll take a quick
2:40:33
break commercial
2:40:40
[Music] break take a ham on r
2:40:47
no sounds good I [Music]
2:40:53
know okay we're going to move uh ahead uh on item three on our agenda this is
2:40:59
our continued review of application for site plan approval mixed use commercial and residential 291 Main Street
2:41:05
submitted by telephone building Beacon LLC good evening good evening uh yes this
2:41:13
is the the um 291 Main Street also known as cookie cutter project number two
2:41:21
um so B basically we we spoke with the applicant about some of the suggestions
2:41:28
that we talked about last time making it a one story building at Main Street trying to you know adjust the
2:41:35
back sorry he he felt that um you know by
2:41:41
reducing it to two stories from the original three-story Main Street you
