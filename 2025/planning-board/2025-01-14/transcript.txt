0:14
give you a shovel or something so we're gonna we're going to spend the next half
0:19
hour in Workshop um it was a suggestion of um Jennifers who is stuck in traffic
0:27
our City attorney that we review since it is the start of the new year we review our planning board rules
0:35
procedure and this is mainly for us
0:40
um so we'll we'll just go through these obviously if you have any questions we'll sit and chat about it but um
0:48
starting from the top these are our um city of Beacon
0:54
planning board rules a procedure for public meetings the city of Beacon planning board this is number one shall
1:01
hold its meetings on the second Tuesday of every month at 7:30 p.m. which may be
1:06
immediately preceded by a work session at 7 we're pretty uh usually very good about this the work sessions also by the
1:13
way help fulfill our uh requirements as board members by the state for uh training
1:20
hours which is good to know
1:27
um all of that unless other otherwise posted and noticed in accordance with lawful requirements membership
1:34
expectations and if any of this is new to you let me know if you have questions about it members are this is item a
1:42
members are expected to attend all duly noticed meetings of the planning board
1:49
Randall Randall also was re-up longest serving member of the
1:55
board in the city's history although I'm proud to say I'm second second how
2:02
manys so I don't know I don't know how you what is it three years years years I have no idea what I justed four
2:09
years is it four yeah this this is the beginning of my sixth
2:15
wow so I've been I've been on the board as long as Randall but Randall's been on
2:20
longer and I started in ' 03 so however many that
2:26
is um members shall be F oh members shall notify the planning board
2:31
secretary and the planning board chair of any expected absences as soon as practicable all you are very good about
2:37
that thank you members shall be familiar with all materials submitted to the planning board in connection with pending
2:44
matters um members should be required to complete all training required by law in the city of Beacon city council for
2:49
service as a planning board member and again can I ask a question about that yeah um does this do we have to do
2:56
additional to the workshops or does the workshop suffice in our training
3:01
requirements in my experience the time we spend in training here has sufficed I
3:07
we get about six hours if we attend every we don't any meetings during right and I think you need a total of four
3:14
hours yeah so it's I think Mercedes sort of loosely keeps track right there was
3:20
some it's on the in the minutes yeah training and couple of years ago there
3:26
was a question about whether we needed to take other train trainings that city
3:31
employees took but it see my recollection is that it was determined that we do not have to take other
3:36
trainings so does that answer your question yeah so we're we're good let's
3:44
see members are expected to be familiar with chapter 45 planning board and Zoning Board of Appeals chapter 86
3:52
architectural design chapter7 Environmental Quality review chapter 123 flood damage
3:58
prevention chapter 20 excuse me 134 historic preservation chapter
4:03
170 public Trail regulations chapter 183 signs chapter
4:10
190 I want to read all these yeah 191 195 there she
4:17
is um 204 220 and 223 the comprehensive
4:23
plan and other plans reports and statutes as are necessary for a member to responsibly discharge their duties
4:30
and all of this material obviously is available on our City's website
4:37
um what is this subnote one rules of procedure are adopted
4:42
pursuant to section 4 and in addition to any requirements ofos the chairperson this is part I like
4:50
um All Shall hail and bout no the executive officer of the planning board
4:56
is the chairperson as designated by the mayor pursu to section 45 -5 the city code the chairperson shall have the
5:02
responsibilities and Authority as specified herein and in the city of Beacon code and state of New York City
5:08
general city law preside at all meetings and hearings of the planning board sign
5:13
all approved final plat site plans and permit approvals issued by the planning board assign all instruments made and
5:19
approved by the planning board perform any other such duties as May from time to time be
5:25
required that's kind of loose and call special meetings of the
5:31
planning board as provided herein we don't often call special meetings of the planning
5:37
board you I don't recall many in my tenure what type of special meetings it
5:44
says as provided you're special no like for example we
5:50
did a visit yeah site visit isn't necessarily a meeting though and we there's a whole
5:57
section on that we can talk about that um no I mean if there's a particular time constraint with respect
6:05
to an action that needs to be taken sometimes you'll schedule a meeting not on the second Tuesday of the month um so
6:14
there there's a variety of different reasons why you might need to call an extra
6:19
meeting everything okay you made there there was a bad accident on the tonic
6:24
just before cross over into Duchess I'm glad you got here okay snagged in that
6:31
um let's see where were we guidelines for planning board
6:36
members we actually I don't know if I mentioned but oh you know yeah Donna has resigned so as of she's not here tonight
6:43
but as of February we'll be down a a board member so we may have to do this again great so she will be here in
6:49
February no okay yeah she's okay she's done um and of course the search is
6:57
on uh let's see guidelines planning board member must be recognized by the presiding officer before speaking and or
7:03
making a motion a member shall address the chair and shall wait to be
7:11
recognized I'm looking at you you need a gavel how of order you
7:17
feel the weird pressure of your eyeballs love you conflict of interest a
7:23
member prevented from par participating in a matter due to a conflict of interest I'll immediately inform the
7:28
chairperson uh good evening happy New Year planning
7:33
board secretary and planning board attorney of such conflict and shall not receive materials pertaining to the matter and shall leave the planning
7:39
board table during discussion shall not vote on the matter and shall otherwise comply with state
7:45
law and city ordinances concerning conflicts of interests and we recommend even a step further not only leave the
7:50
table but the planning board members should leave the room yeah Al together and we then have to just
7:56
remember to call them back um now on disclosure of confidential
8:04
information no planning board member May disclose confidential information um this one's rather long um
8:10
I'm not going to read the whole thing um obviously this is
8:19
um I imagine you will be told specifically when you're about to yeah
8:26
I confident yeah here this is good a confidential information means specific information rather than generalized
8:32
knowledge received by a member as a result of his position that is not available to the general general public
8:37
on request 99.9% of the information that we handle here is obviously public publicly
8:46
recorded both on video uh in notes and on the city's website so I honestly
8:54
can't think of a time when there's ever been anything sensitive enough reviewing these rules earlier today in preparation
9:00
for this work session and I was trying to come up with an example what if there's litigation yeah I mean that's
9:06
yeah and that's attorney client privilege so that's you know in a way that's confidential information there are times when we go into
9:13
executive Council yeah and and those are attorney client privilege conversations
9:19
between the city the board and the city's attorney so to some degree those
9:24
conversations are confidential um but again I I can't
9:30
remember the last time we went to the executive coun information involving an application itself you know there's
9:36
really is public it's all publicly available so there's really and you really you have to be told when you're
9:42
about to receive confidential in so usually it says
9:48
confidential attorney client privileged right uh let's see anything else about
9:56
that we need to cover non-disclosure of confidential imp uh meetings open meetings law all
10:02
meetings of the planning board except for meetings with its attorneys for the purpose of attorney Clan Communications will comply with the requirements of the
10:10
opens meeting open meetings law article 7 of the public officers law um executive sessions may be held when
10:16
authorized pursuant to Section 105 of the public officers law or for other lawful purpose including without
10:23
limitation attorney client communication um again yeah go ahead you may want to
10:28
drill into this one has a whole list of permissible reasons why you can go into closed executive session where the
10:35
public is not allowed to attend um there's a lot that are not relevant to the planning board that would be more
10:41
relevant to to city council proceedings but things like Personnel uh things like
10:46
um litigation discussion of litigation um and then attorney client um
10:52
conversations are exempt from the open meetings law altogether so for example we could have a meeting of a quorum of
10:58
the board with me to discuss attorney client issues um without even noticing
11:04
to the public frankly it's completely exempt from the open meetings law um as long as you're present yes yes as long
11:11
as I'm present and that's yeah it's a discussion uh privileged with your attorney yes yeah and again
11:18
um the one of the nuances of open meetings law is like site site meetings
11:23
if we're all together and we are a quorum that constitutes the requirement for open meetings if you discuss if we
11:30
discuss business right so that's the thing with site visits if typically we don't publicly notice site visits
11:37
because the purpose of a site visit when you're there even if there's a quorum of you there you're there to observe you're
11:43
there to collect factual information you could ask questions um but it's not a
11:48
deliberation it's not a substantive discussion about the application um so
11:55
that that's the the Nuance with with site visits and the other thing too is typically they're on private property
12:01
right so the public unless the private property owner consents the public is is
12:06
actually not allowed to go on to the private property um so I have a question
12:12
about your presence at certain decisions and it's I don't think I've got a chance to ask before but we had a situation
12:18
last year where at a certificate of appropriateness uh portion of the
12:24
meeting applicant brought an attorney okay and you had left because generally
12:29
you're not you don't stay for that and I guess I don't think we we felt that it was a particular concern but my question
12:35
was if at some point we felt that an applicant brought an attorney and we
12:40
didn't have the benefit of council would it be appropriate if the chair decided to say you didn't tell us you were
12:46
bringing an attorney we're feeling not at a you know we're feeling sort of like at a disadvantage without having the
12:53
advice of counsel we'd like to reschedule and then and if you do plan to bring an attorney to certificate
12:59
appropri it would be a courtesy to tell us in advance so that absolutely ask you to be present for for that uh kind of
13:07
instance yeah you shouldn't feel pressured to take an action um if you feel that you need advice of counsel
13:13
before taking that action so it would be appropriate to adjourn in that instance and I don't remember this one was it
13:19
certificate of appropr Highland pleas I guess it was I don't know if that was it was in the second half of the meeting
13:25
but it was after the initial application had been rejected and the applicant came back the
13:31
following month with um with muscle and and an attorney they brought their muscle yeah okay public hearings the
13:39
planning board May hold public hearings in addition to those required by law when it deems such hearings to be in the best interest of the public or are
13:46
required by law any matter for which a public hearing or information session is scheduled by the planning board should
13:52
be placed on a meeting agenda um all public hearings need to be
13:58
noticed absolutely yes that's what I thought yeah there's um the state law requires public hearings to be noticed
14:04
in the newspaper and then your local law requires further mailings yeah and sign notifications doesn't say that here but
14:11
that's just part of our procedure code yeah yeah uh site visits may be
14:16
conducted as a group or separately uh by individual members determination whether
14:21
group site visit will be performed to made at regular scheduled meeting of the planning board site visits are limited
14:27
to touring and obtaining factual information without substantive discussion that's
14:32
the key concerning the merits of any application or other matter pending before the board me this is underlined members of the public are not allowed to
14:39
par participate in site visits unless it is on public property the property owner invites the public to attend the site
14:45
visit Jennifer with regards to that one is there a limit to the number of members that can be at the site at a
14:52
given time no no is the because the key is there's no substantive discussions
14:57
about the application being had I mean there can be a question and answer um but there should not be
15:04
like deliberations and the type of discussion that we would have at a meeting of the
15:09
planning board okay CU I was always under the impression from other councils that you had a limit how many people you
15:16
had otherwise it was almost like you had to notice it as a meeting that's different right you can't have more than
15:21
a certain number of members of the planing board gather informally otherwise it becomes a only if you're
15:27
discussing business substantive so a meeting under the open meetings law quote unquote meeting is a quorum of the
15:33
board gathering for the purpose of discussing business and and actually discussing business so if you're you
15:39
know at a holiday party and there's you know four of you there and you're talking and you're you know how how's
15:46
the family that that's not a meeting um even though four of you are are present in the same place you're not conducting
15:53
business um but similarly at a site visit um if you're just there to collect
15:58
information and not have that deliberative discussion um it's it's been deemed not
16:04
to be a quote unquote meeting so it wouldn't have to be noticed I mean the better way is to have less than a quorum
16:12
go on the site visit because then no you don't have to worry about falling accuse
16:18
us a substantive discussion y okay so proceedings the chair so uh
16:26
chair shall preside at all meetings of the planning board in the chair's absence the acting chair shall preside
16:32
at the meeting and in the event the mayor has failed to appoint an acting chair our acting chair is
16:38
Randall appointed the mayor I don't know if he was appointed it's just been that's how it's been for 20 something
16:45
years um um because I know that's typically who you choose but I remember
16:50
there being a I don't know whether he's I don't know whether he's appointed that's a good question I don't think um or where such member is absent from the
16:57
meeting the chair s shall select another planning board member to preside over that meeting yeah
17:02
typically I don't know how it works this out this way if I'm not able to attend usually Randall is yes so um but if I
17:10
think Len you had Len do it one time also because Randall
17:15
couldn't yeah how did you like that was that fun it's okay okay so if if if it a good
17:23
job I mean I'm curious any any of you others who want a shot at it if you would like to
17:29
know on you know on the off chance that my my Randall or myself obviously Mr
17:35
Jensen has plenty of experience chairing meetings so I think I relied on Jennifer
17:40
to help me with order of business because I wasn't used to it like you are yeah okay so it's rare that we
17:49
neither me nor Randall can attend so but in that
17:54
case yeah I'll do the round robin by email anyway all right so let's see what else
18:02
where are we so notice under New York state law Reen noticing a public hearing is not
18:07
required after the initial public hearing is held and continued to a specified
18:12
date right we don't have to Ren notice every month um however the planning board and planning board attorney may
18:17
require in its discretion the re noticing of a public hearing including newspaper publication mailings and any
18:23
other required public notice in the event of a long adjournment or for other reasons and its sole
18:33
discretion oh okay doing this in order yeah so before
18:39
public comment a formal presentation by the applicant Andor their representatives describing the subject
18:45
proposal shall be made to the board and all others in attendance the chair shall identify all correspondents pertaining
18:50
to the application previously received from the general public and shall enter such correspondence into the record of the public hearing weers are pretty good
18:58
about that um written material submitted by the public during the public hearing shall be given to the planning board chair and
19:03
entered to the record of that public hearing copies thereof shall be given to all board members City staff and the
19:10
applicant within three business days of the date there's times when if there's just a few I'll read
19:15
them um otherwise if there's quite a volume I'll acknowledge them and then
19:20
note that they are then therefore uh made a part of the
19:26
record and then of course available uh to the public uh on on the city's
19:32
website no action shall be taken upon an application that is subject to a public hearing until such time as the public
19:38

motions voting a majority of the whole membership of the planning board including vacancies extensions and any
20:08
members disqualified shall constitute a quorum therefore a quorum of the seven member
20:14

20:20
members present it's a quorum of the whole full board full board yeah always
20:26
minimum four y for shall be necessary to take any formal action and to exercise
20:31
any Power Authority or duty of the planning board no member shall withdraw from a meeting of the planning board
20:37

21:11

21:18
feel like it um any questions about
21:25
that members shall be automatically disqualified on a business interest or financial interest in the outcome of an
21:32
application or other matter before the board or for reasons specified in the code of ethics adopted by the city
21:37
council or the City Beacon um yeah
21:42
usually your your recusal Trump's any disqualification right if you have a
21:48
conflict of interest you're under chapter 29 the ethics code yeah you're recusing yourself and you're not
21:54
participating right all right uh guidelines for comment at a public
22:01
hearing this is more for the public conduct of speakers all persons speaking for the planning board shall conform to
22:06
the following standards of conduct speakers must step to the podium to address the planning board before
22:11
addressing the planning board a speaker must give their name address and organization if any for the record
22:17
speaker shall address all members of the planning board and shall avoid speaking at any one member directly or to the applicant or to the general public
22:24
present at the meeting that's an important one that m that I
22:29
see violated a lot not here necessarily here but elsewhere there's been some
22:36
there's been some it's important that the speaker you the board is is the audience not the applicant not other
22:42
members of the audience or one member of the board exactly so we as a board should be kind of united in calling that
22:49
behavior out if we see it absolutely yeah it just helps keep the temperature at nice level yeah there have been some
22:57
feisty meetings in theast we try to be respectful a speaker's individual time
23:03
to speak at a public hearing may not exceed 5 minutes the chair May reduce such time to no less than three minutes
23:09
if the chair of the planning board determines that an additional time an additional time limitation is appropriate due to the number of items
23:15
on the agenda or the number of people present who wish to speak um speakers shall observe commonly
23:22
accepted rules of courtesy decorum dignity and good taste any statements comments or remarks
23:28
made by the speaker one shall not concern the motives of a member of the planning board and two shall not
23:34
constitute a personal or political attack or criticism of any member of the planning board or any officer of the
23:40
city any consultant of the city any employee of the city or public I'm looking at you
23:49
R should any planning board member communicate with an applicant or its Representatives or member of the public outside of a meeting a member must place
23:55
on the record at the next board meeting the fact that a communication took place the persons with whom such communication
24:02
was made and the substance of the communication John I think oh he did
24:07
yeah here that was the end of this is the end of the speaker guidelines number seven the audience shall be respectful
24:14
of all speakers and shall refrain from comments and gestures such as clapping cheering or
24:20
booing private discussions sometimes we've had challenges with that too private discussions cell phone use or
24:26
otherwise interfere with the meeting any speaker who fails to conform their conduct to the rules provided herein
24:33
shall be directed by the chair to cease speaking and yield the floor the applicant and applicant's
24:39
representative shall be bound to the time limit set forth in but set forth herein but shall be allowed to speak for
24:45
such time as permitted in the sole discretion of the chair all right chair shall make all speakers aware of the
24:51
guidelines for public comment you know it's interesting sometimes when we have big applications
24:56
and there's a ton of people and there's the chance that it'll get Rowdy we do read these rules we do absolutely um and
25:04
we should probably keep a copy of them on the podium for people to reference good idea
25:10
yeah I carry I carry one around in my copies of the guidelines for public
25:16
comments shall be made available to the audience at the meeting along with a copy of the agenda interested parties or their representatives not in attendance
25:22
May address the planning board by written submission prior to the close of the public hearing debate or discussion
25:27
between audience members and the speaker having the floor shall not be permitted uh debate or discussion with
25:33
the speaker on the part of a member of the planning board City attorney City Consultants a guest at the planning board table or any City other City
25:40
employee in the audience who has information pertin pertinent to the discussion shall not be permitted except
25:46
in the chair's discretion all right so advisory
25:51
opinions the planning board May advise and make recommendations oh wow 7:30
25:59
[Music] um we can go through these quickly yeah I think probably the the most important
26:05
one of the remaining points is the one that you skipped to the one I the
26:10
communications that you know planning board members should refrain from having discussions with applicants or members
26:17
of the public outside of this meeting about pending or future applications um and to the extent a
26:26
conversation does happen then planning board member should at the next meeting
26:31
disclose that for the record and summarize what the discussion was but um
26:36
you know those those outside conversations should be avoided yeah and then in order to avoid
26:42
the appearance of impropriety potential applicat and their representatives shall communicate outside of public meetings with the planning board secretary its
26:49
Consultants or attorney rather than planning board members right so just like we just applicants are not
26:55
communicating directly with you yeah outside of regular meetings applicants can contact Mercedes can contact Natalie
27:03
myself John but not the planning board members directly yep um and then number
27:10
11 just talks about uh recording of uh proceedings and meetings minutes uh
27:16
always kept by state law required and they're always again
27:23
they're always on file and available to the public and then
27:28
we can amend these uh from time to time I don't imagine I can't think of any reason why we did amend them re well
27:35
jeez I was going to say recently it was 2018 2018 yeah the video too which is a complete record of the right which is
27:43
available to yep okay any other thoughts questions just a
27:53
a quick question about that you know I I think it's there's this comment you know planning board May advise and make
27:59
recommendations to the city council relating to any subject matter it doesn't have to be um in response to a
28:06
request for review so if we felt
28:11
collectively uh that a certain issue required attention we could recommend it spontaneously right I mean it's
28:18
so and I don't I think we talked about this um really briefly but on the um on
28:23
the short form like the uh the eaf forms there is a a question you know is this a
28:30
National Historic register site has this site been you know discussed by the shipo we don't and I don't know if we I
28:37
don't know if we can modify that form we we can't but we don't we don't have a guideline saying you know is this a is
28:43
this a city designated landmark building you know so uh there are things that are
28:48
like if we felt strongly about something that we could change um we could make a
28:54
spontaneous recommendation to the council or it doesn't even have to go to the council necessarily that's something
29:00
like if you wanted that line item not necessarily in the short form eaf but that could be a line item in like our
29:06
site plan application form for an applicant to check you know not just the
29:11
address section block and lot number but there could be a question is this in the HD or is it a landmarked you know site
29:20
or structure under our local code and that that can just be done administratively changing our our forms
29:29
are you asking for the reasons of recording it or because usually the usually the
29:36
applicant will disclose or it'll have been researched by our our crack Consultants I it was a and
29:43
it was just a off thee cuff example but I'm just saying I think we should you know maybe occasionally at the end of
29:50
the year or something we should think about any particular lessons learned we've had from different applications
29:55
that might cause us to just recommend something and say you know we a year in
30:00
[Music] review sure um can do it individually too and
30:07
we don't even have to wait until the end of the year as something comes up um if it's something that we can handle at the
30:14
consultant or staff level um we can do that to to you know correct course or
30:20
usually usually more efficient best handled yeah as you say in the in the moment cuz it's
30:26
fresh um and then yeah we wouldn't necessarily want to do that at a meeting we could we could take that
30:33
offline even yes yeah absolutely because that's usually administrative okay um well there we go
30:43
happy New Year everybody Welcome to the January 2025 meeting of the city of Beacon planning
30:49
board um we will start our regular meeting we're going to jump right in um
30:57
we don't have December minutes yet to approve so we'll hold those over until next
31:03
month um so we'll start with our first uh item on the agenda that being the
31:08
continued review uh an application for site plan and subdivision approval mixed use commercial and residential 45
31:15
beakman Street High Street and High Street submitted by beakman Art Center um and Bay Studios good evening happy
31:23
New Year for allow to still say that I feel like it's been a year since we saw you um for record Taylor Palmer with the
31:28
law firm of cudy and fader on behalf of the applicant uh as the chairman mentioned we are before you tonight uh in our continued review of the
31:34
subdivision uh and site plan approval for uh the project and specifically more focused on the Seeker review tonight I
31:41
am joined as always by ARA seagull the architect for the troublemaker and public hearings our project engineer
31:46
Justin dates and our traffic consultant uh Rich D Andrea by way of brief update on January 2nd we did submit a
31:52
supplemental package to you all uh that included minor updates to uh the project in response to your comments uh the
31:58
meeting that we had in December uh these updates did include uh redesigning the access Hardscape to uh and the
32:05
landscaping around the beakman building uh from New York State Route 90 and uh the beakman intersection as Justin will
32:11
touch on uh shortly the new layout includes and I had to actually listen to the phonetic way of saying this the
32:17
curvy linear walkways or curv linear uh walkways with both steps uh and ramps to
32:23
address some of those elevation changes and I know Natalie's comment memo included some inconsistencies that you'll see updated in the renderings
32:29
before you that were submitted today um and then with some Landscaping we propos low plantings in front of the AIS area
32:35
so that not Impe any sight lines uh and then of course the I shouldn't say of course but the proposal does have a
32:40
sculpture area uh displayed and remains as a component of that design we did uh propose some additional Landscaping on
32:46
the northwest side uh of the site which provides buffering and screening for the neighboring properties uh with enhanced
32:52
shade and canopy trees as well uh the latest submission did include a full storm water uh prevention
32:58
plan in responses to this with comments from Mr Russo in response to one of Natalie's comments as I just mentioned
33:04
um we did update those renderings so uh I'll have Justin and re speak to how the they tried to align those plans uh going
33:11
forward so before I turn over to them just a few more updates uh for the purpose of our secret discussion the
33:17
applicant has gone through a very exhaustive narrative analysis we did put that in uh our most recent submission to try and address some of the Seeker
33:24
considerations that are before you uh to consider all the potential uh envirment Al considerations and we we we believe
33:30
the record supports uh finding for a negative declaration uh that will not have any potentially significant adverse
33:36
environmental impacts certainly if the board has more questions on any of those items naturally we'll be prepared to
33:41
respond to those uh we would note uh that of course the adoption of any secret findings as we move forward in the project doesn't end uh your view uh
33:49
we still have a number of other approvals including that with the zoning board uh together with public hearings uh for both the site plan and
33:55
subdivision so the board certainly has significant enabl jurisdiction related to site plan or subdivision issues
34:01
moving forward so with that AR why don't you uh take the first crack to kind of align these things I'll speak to Justin
34:07
after that then we'll have AR excuse me then we'll have Rich give you just an update about what dot we do have new updates from do okay um and then I'll
34:14
I'll save my joke uh for DOT for for after so just gota we're do we're doing jokes in 2025 oh yeah okay oh
34:24
yeah it was part of my New Year's resolution but I already broke it
34:31
okay good evening happy New
34:41
Year so uh yeah I got I got the updated renderings this morning so I asked
34:47
Mercedes to get those out and hopefully you have those newer ones now but um so
34:53
so basically we adjusted several details since the previous meeting and we incorporated the suggestions that um
35:00
came from the ARB meeting and our last meeting as well so the
35:07
um yeah since since these are new to us I was hoping you could if you were
35:14
about to uh just walk us through what specifically from the
35:21
meetings you're responding to okay yeah yeah basically I believe we hit the all
35:26
the um points that we talked about at the ARB um you know plus what we talked about last month um so so one one thing
35:36
was the the sides of the tower in the corner are now you know metal panel
35:41
instead of brick um that was uh suggested at the ARB meeting so it it
35:48
sort of sits in between the brick sections um the proportions of the you
35:54
know the the window panels between the second and third floor are got smaller you know with larger windows and more
36:00
aligned with um how The Brick Works in in between there the the frames of the
36:08
arcade openings were thinned out um because they were reading is kind of
36:14
chunky in those in those openings the entry
36:20
Plaza is now conformed with um you know what we're showing on the site plan
36:25
which uh Justin will talk about more as well but what what we were trying to do is sort of have some alternate paths in
36:32
there and you know so you can get at it from different parts of the of the corner or the streets uh surrounding it
36:40
and um that they have like a gentle curve some are just ramps some have steps and then you know the in between
36:47
space is uh landscaped and has that area for sculpture or
36:53
something the see which one shows this the best
37:03
we also added um a signage idea and what
37:08
what that would be is um the lettering on the sign that's sort of suspended within the arcade opening and and that
37:15
you know depending on where the store is that that could be um anywhere along the
37:20
arcade and it it would be solid uh letters on some kind of perforated or
37:25
mesh metal panel so you can still get light um through there and and you know
37:32
from the inside of the arcade and the Reta retail spaces uh we also um updated the brick
37:40
sections so there's a lot more um texture and depth on the other brick
37:47
sections apart from just where the corner is and we also took a look at
37:55
the the um you both Tower designs um and change the proportions you know based on
38:02
what we were talking about last month as well so those were the main things and
38:07
then um can I ask what is the texture on the sides of the tower
38:13
now um on the corner Tower
38:19
yeah it it's it it's just sort of like a vertical fluted metal panel so so it has
38:25
um something besides the the flat you know metal that the frames
38:33
have but but it it would be metal and the same color but you know just have have a slightly different
38:39
texture so the change in tone within the metal panels you're
38:44
saying that's happening because of the texture and the
38:50
way lights hitting it so it's all intended to be a
38:55
a monolithic color well that that there there's an option you know what what I
39:01
was looking at here was to make that instead of that charcoal gray to do that as sort of like a grayish green but then
39:08
I also just um as an option because we talked about it um I I have this color
39:15
you know color change version of where the metal panel will be different the one you see up
39:22
there we were talking about just you know exploring other yeah there was a discussion about looking at a like you
39:28
said a gray green for the metal instead of the charcoal yeah so so I just have I
39:33
there's a little bit of mix and match um but also you know this particular
39:39
rendering shows it as if you know we're we're going with green instead of that charcoal gray whichever color you go
39:45
with all of the metal will be the same color yeah I think so I mean unless we want to differentiate the corner tower
39:51
for some reason but I I you I think it's probably going to be consistent yeah I don't think there's enough of it to
39:58
to differentiate yeah so what what are you suggesting that
40:03
you so and also I can't tell whether because in this version it looks like the metal in
40:10
this view on this part of the building is green right yeah yeah that's a that's
40:15
a different this was the option you were showing with a different color yeah yeah the the the original was this oh oh oh
40:22
see it just changed okay yeah just as as an option because we talked about you know exploring some other colors the the
40:30
the applicant is you know good with either one um so I don't know if if you guys have an opinion about
40:36
it that may have been your comment about looking at a greay green right and I remember do you have any during our
40:42
meeting there was there was an example that you had done that was that was too much right what we
40:49
learned from that right was that you it has to be a very subtle um and the
40:54
problem with that is as you well know uh there's only so many things that are manufactured you need to find somebody
41:00
that makes a material that's as subtle as the renderer makes it right and and
41:05
so I what came up for me was whether or not um we should have uh uh samples
41:12
provided yeah right yeah we we'll definitely have material samples and and the you know flat Dimension noted
41:18
elevations but um I just wanted to to in this one rendering Kevin the the clock
41:24
tower is done in the greenish gray versus the charcoal just to let people see so nobody seems to have a strong do
41:31
you have a strong feeling about it I think that's the that's the range you want you need to work in I think because it's still a neutral but it has some uh
41:39
chroma to it you know and uh it won't stand out the way that the first you know the first past it it uh uh it look
41:47
still looks like it's a a material you know yeah like it has materiality it's not like a coat of paint yeah and and
41:55
and we yeah we'll definitely have you know color samples and and and a brick sample so you see how they go
42:01
together um I'm also curious too um the
42:06
tower the tower at the top is obviously a square right yeah but then as it comes
42:12
down and starts to meet the building it does this sort of flare thing like Wing walls what I would call them compared to
42:18
the cross-section of the clock bases yeah that's how I was kind of negotiating that angle of the corner cuz
42:25
it's not um it's basically it it it's in between both of
42:30
those angles just a subtle thing but is there any way for you to articulate that front face come back off of the front
42:37
face before you start that flare just to make that front face feel like a volume
42:43
onto itself so sort of drop the the angle part no no no no I mean I can see why
42:49
you would need the angle to make that connection yeah but to make it lower lower than it
42:54
is go perpendicular to the front for distance and then angle I don't often do
43:01
this but it would be like this uh how does that work flare
43:10
flare so feel look you're not in plan bring just bring the flare back off the corner a little bit oh okay yeah so that
43:18
so that that Tower reads and you even get a shadow line yeah it could relate to it could relate
43:25
to the um articulation at the top of the tower right where there's the corners right
43:32
right so then that that gives that sort of vertical emphasis so just yeah just push that flare back a little bit I
43:39
think it's easier to build that way too it's more you don't have a the thing that's detailed in the air it's yeah you
43:48
know like a parit it's dying into the other wall is that what you meant yeah
43:53
yeah like again it's from the top view oh I see right yeah yeah give the maintain the re the are and start the
44:01
wing walls farther back to but I would also I'm wondering whether or not uh lowering that pulling this down you the
44:08
corice right that that but also where the top of that chamfer happens rather
44:14
than it terminating above the cornice of the pier dropping it down so that it's I agree with you it diminishes the
44:22
prominence you follow what he's talking about yeah the the the the upper corners of that angle thing would come down yeah
44:29
we're down to this point it's nice this is the funest part taking this down so it's below this Corners yeah I don't
44:36
know if I've did totally below but I I can see adjusting it I mean not not not aligned and maybe
44:43
not below but maybe less above I think it should pop out of there but I think if it were aligned or below it would
44:50
give this verticality more prominent yeah I mean I can look at that yeah and then
44:57
I'm curious about the different languages on these elements these elements kind of get and maybe you've
45:03
discussed them in detail on the committee but these
45:09
elements I like this thing but then these elements I don't know why there's a different language on one face to the
45:18
other on the prism now uh whatever your I call it no I mean un unless there's
45:26
something with the rendering it it should go all the way around like that well you've got you've got these sort of
45:34
pieces up here articulated somehow and then this one here it's it's
45:40
this whole sort of very very modern oh well I mean those are those are like Dormers going into that larger
45:48
um gable roof oh I see it's a it's a series of Dormers and that was intended
45:54
you know first to sort of bring the scale down then also start you know H hinting at the uh the fact that there's
46:01
those single family residences with um Gable roofs going up that
46:07
street is there a straight on elevation of that uh you can see it better there's
46:13
like the one from looking down be high streight yeah that's the one shows a
46:19
little bit yeah I don't know there's there's just something a little too fussy about
46:24
this business up here the picture framing on it yeah these the
46:29
well the lights second right but I mean part of it is the border and the Border yeah I mean you see how this is right it
46:37
works there but it's the scale's wrong for the Gable right it should just be a roof it should just be yeah should be
46:45
that extra part in instead of articulating that Gable end well yeah I mean I think the Forum makes sense but
46:52
then somehow yeah adding this element within here is a little fussy you saying
46:57
the the lattice inside the yeah yeah the the grids inside the Gable ends
47:04
B it looks just looks out of character I mean I can understand
47:09
wanting to start to sort of you know diminish scale as you go up I don't know maybe take a look at
47:16
that
47:21
yeah and then like like I said we also looked at um you know those other
47:27
sections of brick as you go down away from the corner are a lot more um articulated and they think that that
47:33
works better yeah I'm I'm I'm liking how now this this corner is at least
47:38
starting to engage the street a little bit better MH there's just there's activity here
47:45
and IT addresses the street and it'll be nice when these all
47:52
mature
47:57
I'm still not convinced that in this image here
48:04
though does the topography really work this way oh no that for some reason I I
48:09
went over that but maybe they didn't have time to fix that it's it's flatter in there yeah I I want to really
48:15
understand what that relationship yeah because that's an important sort of yeah
48:20
expanse I know it's all private property but it's visible yeah no I I'm I'm get them to
48:28
fix that and then yeah this is something
48:34
that I know um is addressed by our planner notes at least in plan this
48:41
front Plaza it still looks very
48:47
confused um so maybe we can talk about that uh yeah like I said we we were
48:55
trying to you know allow for some different approach choices rather than
49:00
just like hitting it head on um perpendicular to the tower but
49:05
um you know I mean if if if there's a way to make that a little more clear you
49:11
know maybe it's a a different kind of Paving there or something or well I'm so
49:16
I'm so I'm hoping I think we talked about this last time that this isn't that stamped asphalt stuff that's
49:22
already it won't be we'll choose pvers don't do that we could show you those too
49:29
yeah I think yeah this area just needs a little bit more explanation as to what the intent is and how it works I think
49:35
it's reading better in the renderings than it was in the plan View at least as long you know if landcaping is like kept
49:43
low um that visibility but I think there also was a nice quality that kind of
49:52
what we were seeing before you know where it was like a grand kind of entrance to it but I this this space
49:59
looks nicer to sit like folks might actually sit there
50:04
I mean also just you know because it's on the corner and it could be approached from different ways you know we thought
50:10
that it might be nice to be able to like you know gently work your way in from a couple of
50:17
spots now is I have a question is the elevation as it shown on the the of that
50:22
um Plaza in front of the entrance is it all level from the side walk or does it
50:27
drop down yeah uh Justin D ky's engineering design so um as we spoke
50:34
last time it does the elevation from the Street intersection it does drop down to the finished floor elevation of the
50:39
building what's the it's about 2.4 feet it's like 2 and 1/2 ft okay so that's
50:45
what we're trying to Traverse Traverse over that space and we've done that by
50:50
and you could kind of there's a couple of steps in like the center uh curval linear um walk ways there's two steps to
50:58
get down to that uh elevation and then the the outside walkway that kind of
51:04
sweeps around on the Northern side there that's a ramp again to Traverse that
51:09
elevation change Justin why don't you pull up the site plan view of that enlarge that area so they can see
51:21
that seems crazy those yeah it's crazy
51:27
it's a little confusing this's High Street have you
51:35
have you developed this with sections through the different streets and sidewalks uh like ACR no we didn't do
51:42
cross section through no but I mean what we what we want to do based on last
51:47
presentation and the the um the feedback that we got from the board you know we had it was I think the board felt was
51:53
kind of rigid didn't you know necessarily fit and connect the building to the to the streetscape so this was
51:59
our you know our next shot at at that and uh a couple things was the grade change uh that I just spoke about and as
52:06
arier mentioned you know we're not directly at the corner of this intersection right the right of way area
52:12
uh on 9d is substantially further back than what we have on on beakman right so
52:19
we're we're trying to you know connect that full space um while adjusting for
52:25
the grade change and you know we did incorporate some landscape areas in there to break up The Hardscape right we
52:33
didn't want to have just kind of a mass uh Hardscape of of walkways there we did want to to break that up we do have a
52:40
series of low plan things in those landscape areas again to not impede uh the view shed and you know all AR's work
52:46
at the uh the corner uh portion of the of the building there
52:51
um and we do you know we do like this one uh you know better than our initial iteration on
52:58
this and the and I'm sorry just one other clarification there's a proposed sidewalk connection that comes through
53:05
that area that's farther uh on 9d on 90 no there's there's no uh
53:12
there's no access what elevation that's to access the back yeah to the north it goes It goes down and follows the grade
53:19
down to you know what is on the north end of the building that pitches down it does down correct and there's a sidewalk
53:26
it looks like there's a sidewalk going to that our our Corner entrance Landscaping is that at that level or is
53:34
that lower you see what I'm saying it looks like there's another sidewalk
53:40
drawn parallel at the edge of the building this I'm sorry right
53:48
here talking yeah this curves and goes this way and then there's another walkway there yeah what elevation is
53:54
that so that starts up at the the Finish FL elevation goes down goes down
54:01
okay no sorry it it's I don't know if you need to reiterate that for
54:07
the so the let me see here the location that we were speaking
54:13
about is right here if everyone can see that so that does start at the same uh
54:20
basically meets the finished floor elevation and as you go to the north it pitches down
54:26
it falls grade down right so we can go around the building on that North Side
54:32
so on the renderings there'll be a a sidewalk sort of in a valley right going
54:38
from the entrance level down to the level of uh grade at the rear of the
54:44
building correct right yep and with it so with that grade with
54:50
that elevation change you know there's no uh connection right into the arcade
54:55
right on that on that leg of the building I I'm wondering whether that's required because there's another walkway
55:02
there's a there's the city sidewalk right there's a city sidewalk
55:07
and then we do provide from 9d
55:14
just just because of the oh why is it moving here we go
55:21
oh you see what I'm saying so your sidewalk along 9d is up high along the road and then the topography really
55:27
drops off as you go down into our site so we we did provide the an alternate sidewalk to get to this Northern side of
55:33
the building from that location because it's that much shorter than going all the way around to the
55:41
entrance the beginning of that connection another point of access to get to that side of the building um but also with a grade change right I mean I
55:50
I I understand that I I was imagining myself walking down this sort of like
55:56
sloped area from a highway to the building and it just didn't seem like a that there was a lot of demand
56:02
pedestrian demand for it like a lot of people would be making that walk around to the back it's not a public access
56:07
area to the stores and it might not uh um um you might want to look at whether
56:16
that's I I I it's it feels a little awkward to make you know it draws
56:21
attention to the fact that there's this uh uh the transition you need in Gra
56:27
um that's not reflected in the renderings you know and I I it's hard to
56:32
visualize in your mind what's happening with that space in three dimensions you know because of the way they have to
56:38
manage the grade um but it's a lot better than it was I'm
56:43
nitpicking about that and I just wanted to see if that was a uh like a program requirement that you needed to have that
56:51
uh walkway there no it was just more so to try to provide you know easy access around that
56:57
portion of the building just because you're not you're not walking in on any location right into the arcade right on
57:03
that side so that was that was the thought and and there'll be an arcade there above right there's actually an
57:10
arcade inside the building correct and that just terminates that's a dead end up there at that end right there's no stairs like it is on the other side
57:17
which is fine correct at that point when you turn actually make that little curve you're sort of below the end of the
57:22
arcade right on that side of the building see residents trying to get yes you are you are lower than the arcade at
57:29
that point Y um what is the what what material are you proposing for that
57:36
path uh the front one that we're just speaking no no no the one the Kevin path this right now is just a a concrete
57:44
sidewalk but it could be there's obviously all materials that we could work into yeah I think we want to think
57:49
about that maybe that's a bit of a softer material sure um I'm just curious um can you
57:56
bring your architect back love talking to you but I have a question for
58:03
sorry question so I'm sure that uh the Consultants have
58:09
mentioned is just as part of the application bit of cleanup why is this
58:16
here this looks like a completely different building oh that that is that on the
58:22
site section yeah there's a disclaimer note somewhere on that Dr TR the old
58:28
objects in Mirror are larger many previous versions back right is what that is
58:33
yeah cuz it's it's confusing the iteration control is out
58:39
of control and then I'll just go back to what I believe is the most
58:45
recent what is this is that an elevator overrun yeah
58:52
that's a bulkhead for the elevator but you got to work on that yeah it's just
58:58
not it just doesn't sit right yeah um you know it it's it starts to
59:06
compete with you when you look at this composition and from this view you know
59:11
this sort of Rhythm and this just this sort of plunk there out of place I
59:19
mean I can understand you know some other articulation here but right just
59:24
as a sort of a kind of a what looks like a monolithic block of some neutral material just
59:33
doesn't make sense at all yeah no I I'll look at that I I I don't I didn't really
59:38
want to make like a whole articulated Tower but but I you're hoping it would just disappear right it's not going to
59:45
draws your eyes to it the corner Tower because it's so out of place and the thing that nobody's commented on is you
59:51
know that the articulation of that top story right which we discussed nobody's
59:56
because nobody's noticed it because it kind of It kind of works right it's the simple thin lines whatever but that that
1:00:04
is um you can make that work with that I think you could improve
1:00:09
it well it looks like it looks like coru on top of you know couple his me on top
1:00:17
cor's child yeah I I don't I think we really
1:00:23
got to work on what's happening at the top yeah you know along not only the
1:00:28
um the build this building but this building as you know as mentioned you know because those those
1:00:35
elements also are going to be quite visible they seem like I know that you know they're usable space but just in
1:00:40
terms of the design and the cohesiveness they seem a little out of place now I'll
1:00:46
look at those okay um since we're on the sort of
1:00:54
Architectural Review portion of the I just jumped right in um anything else board you want to add for the applicant
1:01:01
I think two next time you submit like I understand you know it's an iter iterative process but when we're looking
1:01:07
at stuff let's just make sure we're looking at the most recent just the most recent yeah the the this the scheduling
1:01:14
has just been a little funny with the holidays and stuff but David Burke were here you'd be he'd be yelling at
1:01:20
you I'm being nice can uh I have a yes I have a few landscape questions questions
1:01:26
and and comments landscape let me call my colleague
1:01:35
back hi um I am looking at the um the
1:01:43
corner of you know beakman and 9d and the planting that is in the
1:01:50
rendering um and then looking at your plant
1:01:56
list um it doesn't seem like the plant list is going to get you the effect that
1:02:03
is shown in the rendering and I think the um the looseness of the rendering I
1:02:11
appreciate and I like um I think the boxwood along the The Edge that you have
1:02:17
called out in the plan is um much more manicured going to give you a much more
1:02:22
manicured and kind of suburban effect what's shown in the rendering um so you
1:02:28
might want to think about that plant Choice particularly the boxwood and also
1:02:35
um the father Gilla that you've um identified is not going to grow that
1:02:41
tall you might want to consider a different variety of that you know
1:02:46
there's there's other varieties that will grow taller the one that you have on your plant list is going to get you
1:02:53
know maybe 3 ft tall at at best yeah which I think is kind of the height
1:02:58
where I want to be just with that being along the um the facade and in between
1:03:05
where the the storefronts are I didn't want to have you know things growing too
1:03:11
too much higher you know around that and I thought the the box would too could be you know easily um maintained at that at
1:03:18
that height um as I said there is some grade change there too so I was kind of using the boxwood as a almost a barrier
1:03:25
right so someone's not you know trying to Traverse that that space um and focuses on going to where the walkways
1:03:32
are okay well then it's it's going to look different than the
1:03:38
rendering I mean the rendering the plants are almost as tall as the people and they're behind the you
1:03:45
know behind the people on the corner there not in that view the one that um
1:03:51
was it the one I was just on or no there's no people in that one it's
1:03:58
kind of from afar like looking across 9d at the corner so you can see the whole
1:04:04
span this guy yeah that yeah this one okay that one if
1:04:12
if you zoom in on the the plantings that are going down
1:04:18
beakman okay yeah those are those do look larger than it's just looking much more you know um
1:04:26
kind of loose and wild than what your plant list is is calling so there should
1:04:33
be some clarification on you know which way you're going gotcha okay the plants and the renderings look to be at least
1:04:40
five you know 5 ft tall under the uh under the under the oak canopy or under
1:04:46
whatever those trees are yeah understood okay um while we're on it can we talk
1:04:52
about those benches and the garbage cans is that a hard design Choice you've made are you married to it no no we were
1:05:00
trying to just convey like the locations that we wanted to have them um you know if the board has some alternative colors
1:05:08
or uh uh whatnot we'd be open to that um
1:05:13
I I just think something a little more in keeping with the
1:05:19
character and the direction that you're going with the building mhm something that's maybe RW iron or something a
1:05:26
little more I don't yeah a little less yeah these are not not as much uh not as
1:05:32
solid you know oh yeah you know like more minimal yeah both the I I agree some you
1:05:39
know obviously you want something that somebody's going to want to sit in sure
1:05:44
but just the aesthetic of these it just seems really disjointed in relationship to the rest
1:05:50
of the the building composition
1:05:55
yeah no problem we could come up with some
1:06:01
Alternatives
1:06:12
um yeah okay in that that particular planting
1:06:17
area that we were that I was just talking about um on the beakman street just at the start of the beakman street
1:06:23
facade uh how high above grade is um you
1:06:29
know the I guess like the sill of those steel
1:06:36
openings the window open like like where's the window sill in relation to the
1:06:41
grade so you're talking about uh along the arcade uh yes but on beakman on
1:06:53
beakman so this this one from here yeah from the corner down
1:06:58
yeah down to the steps just generally it looks like it's
1:07:11
it's yeah from the up at the intersection down to the end you know
1:07:17
the uh the Western end of this building I believe is around 6 feet or so as it
1:07:22
fls down the street it might be even a little bit more than that actually okay so the window sills roughly um uh or the
1:07:30
arcade openings the sill of the arcade opening just before you know on the uphill side of the entrance there on
1:07:37
beakman are they roughly like 3 ft above grade um let me
1:07:45
see because I think that's going to inform plant choices also you know like
1:07:51
you can't have the same plant at the uphill you know like at the corner yeah
1:07:58
on the uphill side of beakman you know and also at the downhill side of Beacon
1:08:03
and and get the same effect
1:08:09
understood just two more questions is the clock intended to be
1:08:20
illuminated it is okay and then um I'm not sure sure if you've represented them
1:08:27
anywhere in plan yet but any kind of Mechanicals that you got on the
1:08:32
roof um I'd love to know where they're going to land and how you're going to visually screen
1:08:39
them I don't know if we've talked about that yet the Mechanicals we don't think we
1:08:49
yeah yeah I mean they're on the upper roof and they'd be set back towards the
1:08:54
middle uh I mean I'll I'll see if you'd actually see them from which drawing
1:08:59
have you located them on H have you located them on the drawings yet no okay
1:09:05
will you do so yeah yeah at some point okay yeah and one want a clear
1:09:10
description of the screening um I know that you've you've shared this the sight lines from at
1:09:18
least two potential Vantage points from High Street but I'm I'm still not convinced that individuals at highest
1:09:25
point of High Street aren't going to have a clear view of the roof of this thing um so yeah we really have to
1:09:32
be conscientious about number one this Spate of mechanical units that get
1:09:40
placed but then for some reason the owner forgets the screening or it's an afterthought um yeah I'd really like to
1:09:48
make sure that before we finalize this we've thought about this and we've got clear understanding of what's Happening
1:09:55
okay okay can I one yeah just one quick question for Raa about the on either
1:10:02
side of the clock tower there are the two columns that are steel instead of brick like the
1:10:08
others and I'm just kind of curious about what the decision was with that it's a it's a tiny bit it's on the
1:10:14
corner with the clock on either side of it it's a little jarring the switch for me from from what what to
1:10:22
what these guys right here there's those two steel columns on the ground level on either side of the Clock Tower every
1:10:28
every other one is Brick between oh yeah right here yeah on that I I wanted to
1:10:34
try to differentiate that and and have like The Wider opening but it it seemed
1:10:40
just a little bit too wide I mean you know we could go with prick but I wanted to you know build that corner a little
1:10:47
bit differently I kind of it butts up against a a sort of you know brick
1:10:52
plaster element above it mhm yeah it looks it kind of looks like there was an old building here and you knocked out
1:10:59
that column and you put in some it yeah I mean it could be brick easily enough I you I was just trying to get a little
1:11:05
bit of a different articulation there this yeah if you're going to do that I
1:11:11
think you have to make it into a feature right and I think I don't think it's worth it you know what I mean it's like
1:11:17
a distraction from the main event of the Tower and uh uh I think if you made it
1:11:23
just a slight variation on the rest of the arcade columns uh because it's different you know it's a different
1:11:29
condition that I it would look more uh um natural you know okay I'll I'll look
1:11:34
at that yeah it looks like it it was a support piece that was cut out and then
1:11:42
replaced with a metal piece anyway all right
1:11:50
um anything else as we continue our Architectural Review
1:11:58
okay so did you have other items that you wanted to share with us as a as a team yeah
1:12:10
please yeah just real real quick we wanted to just give you an update on where we are with DOT on the land
1:12:16
acquisition portion so we had gotten some car respondents in an email from do back last Wednesday um basically kind of
1:12:23
giving us an update on where they're at their review of the acquisition request and basically they they've completed
1:12:31
their engineering review of that which is what we knew we hadn't received any indication of that in writing but we
1:12:38
knew that was the case they had indic they indicated that at this point they haven't they're okay with what we're
1:12:44
requesting as far as the overall limits of of property um the next steps are it
1:12:50
needs to go to the regional director's office for approval and then it goes up to the main main office in Albany um as
1:12:58
far as time frame once hits the main office in Albany we kind of lose a lot of control over you know how things go
1:13:04
go it kind of follows its own path unfortunately once it gets up to there um but our initial estimate when we
1:13:11
started this process was it was going to be a year-long process starting we started back in June so our best guess
1:13:17
is we about halfway through that process at this point so okay that's good to
1:13:23
know so we wanton see you for a couple months I don't know it depends on what else comes
1:13:28
up importantly I would add that same email U the group that I had to bring my
1:13:33
joke back but the group that they're meeting with is actually referred to as the property Executive revie review
1:13:39
group so perg for short or pergatory is where we are so with that that that being said not withstanding do if you're
1:13:45
listening we love you but you know we're trying to get there so um with that the design that they have put forth that we
1:13:51
would UL develop a map for and then ultimately prepare uh an appraisal for that's part of the acquisition of that
1:13:57
land it doesn't what so far what's been requested are any changes it doesn't include additional lands from do from 9d
1:14:04
they had proposed initially potentially give you know giving more than we asked for um and then the change the limited
1:14:09
change that they have doesn't impact the site design whatsoever they've talked about an additional area of about one foot related to the sidewalks doesn't
1:14:16
change any of the sort of functioning building design or anything else okay so you're just waiting for it to make its
1:14:21
way through and Y hoping that it comes back yeah all indications have been that
1:14:27
it's everything we've designed that that it's consistent with what they're looking for okay all right anything else
1:14:34
I have one more request yeah please on the the rendering arier of that area
1:14:39
between the two buildings the landscape that you're going to ask them to improve
1:14:45
um can you have them put a car in the parking area so we could see how much of
1:14:50
the car is visible like there's a parking area right behind the bio retention that will help
1:14:57
um yeah I'll get that area yeah I'll put the car in
1:15:04
there okay um he always uses that like BMW X3 it's always his
1:15:11
favorite so let's let's spend some time with our Consultants latest reviews um
1:15:18
starting with you Mr rouso so the applicant has submitted a
1:15:23
full Swip storm water pollution ition plan for the project showing that they can comply with dec's requirements um
1:15:30
they have noted that soil testing has not been conducted out there as of yet one that is to be performed Justin
1:15:37
please let us know so we can be present and witness that testing uh depending
1:15:43
upon the results of that that may require some modifications to their design um but we'll wait and see what
1:15:51
comes out of that um as far as all of the previous comments we had um they're
1:15:57
still working on addressing all of those regards to sore connections
1:16:03
utilities uh so on and so forth um rich I had one question for you with regards
1:16:09
to dot since you've had recent have they updated you any more on the
1:16:14
Adaptive signals or where they stand with getting that I haven't inquired
1:16:20
about that but I can try and get you an update okay yeah I know they were looking around this time to get that
1:16:27
fully functional but yeah I'll see if we can get I'll see if we can get an update on that yeah cuz when we had the
1:16:33
conference call they were yeah it was early this year process right so I'll see if we can get an update on
1:16:41
that Natalie um I think many of my comments
1:16:47
have been addressed I think the first one had to do with the architectural changes that we kind of walked through today and consistency between the
1:16:53
renderings and the site plan so that's been disc discussed um the the second
1:16:58
comment was about the kind of pedestrian Plaza again and I think we've commented
1:17:04
on that a little bit I just you know where we ended the last meeting I think
1:17:10
either the board and myself or or myself were asking for a little bit more of direct pedestrian connections
1:17:17
specifically from the crosswalks right there's two crosswalks where pedestrians are going to be Crossing and coming to this corner and folks tend to like to
1:17:25
walk in a direct in a the shortest route possible right so I think this these
1:17:30
curval linear this curval linear Plaza goes a different direction from that
1:17:36
um so I think you know I think explaining the
1:17:42
intent there I think we should always just be thinking about the pedestrians and how they're going to be using this right one of the main points is to get
1:17:47
into these retail spaces right they're going to be coming from from Main Street
1:17:53
um and trying to act access this and so I think you've achieved it really nice on the southern or on the side of the
1:17:59
building kind of facing the train station when you're coming up from the train station and you're looking at the
1:18:04
kind of the High Street Building you get this nice view of like here's my access point I go up these stairs and I'm there
1:18:09
and this is a little bit I think we it's come a long way with the champ I always
1:18:15
mess up on that word champer champer uh on I think that's really highlighted
1:18:21
this as the access point so I think that's come a long way as well as the arcade openings and being able to see the actual retail businesses in there so
1:18:28
um I was thrown off a bit by the site plan you know I think as I said it it
1:18:35
looks a little bit more cohesive from the renderings but let you know maybe just some more angles rather than curbal
1:18:41
linear just kind of walk us through where as pedestrians are coming here what they're doing they're kind of like
1:18:47
skirting around skirting around landscaping or where do we think they're coming from how are they accessing the
1:18:53
site um I do appreciate the collocation of things like the Landscaping benches
1:18:59
trash cans all that together creates this like triangulation that really helps create like somewhere you want to
1:19:05
sit and for a moment so I do appreciate that as well as just the addition of benches but I've said this a number of
1:19:11
times like the focus of the linkage district is this like pedestrian engagement so that's why I keep kind of
1:19:17
harping on this and I think the other small landscaped area um where you've created a little bit of a refuge there
1:19:24
um so those two pieces uh and then the other aspect was
1:19:29
lighting plan I know we said this was forthcoming um it looks like there's there's sconces
1:19:36
kind of on the exterior of the building that maybe so just updating the lighting plan I think to match what the intent is
1:19:42
just curious about the arcades too and the intent there um and the lighting of
1:19:47
that just because it is a unique space there so um I think you could do something really interesting with
1:19:53
Lighting in there to again draw people towards those resident those uh retail
1:20:00
businesses thank you um yeah no just again back to this um you know again in
1:20:07
plan I see this is you know evolved from the last time we looked at it and you know I I think to somewhat um
1:20:17
Natalie's point I don't know if I'm going articulated in any better but it
1:20:22
just it doesn't seem to kind of follow a natural flow of
1:20:28
people especially as they make their way you know if they're not looking to
1:20:33
access this point here and some to some degree even if they are it just it doesn't seem like
1:20:39
it I think part of what I if I may I know this is from prior conversations when we talked about where you should
1:20:44
put a path and this is not you know this is Taylor putting his design hat on the best you know paths or Trails or
1:20:50
sidewalks in this case kind of make themselves least resistance right and so to the extent the curvy line linear you
1:20:56
know Corner coming off of 9d you know folks are probably going to try and cut that corner if they're going there in the first place so you're absolutely
1:21:02
right that coming across the street maybe they're want to want to come straight in but the folks that are coming down 9d may try and curve in and
1:21:09
ultimately we're also trying to navigate the differentiation in in in you know in the gra yeah no there there's no doubt
1:21:15
that there's a lot there's a lot happening and you know even when you think about a change of materials it
1:21:21
just sort of it visually right sort of says something to the Walker um so you
1:21:27
know we may want to think about that and then again your renderings don't necessarily show unless I missed it this
1:21:32
element here you know this sort of location for a sculpture which I think is a nice
1:21:39
addition but again it's um it's just it's not cohesive like I
1:21:44
can't understand it as a cohesive composition just yet the three plantings see this shade
1:21:53
oh behind two people in the one rendering is that oh I see so she's
1:21:59
standing in front of a sculpture yeah it's got plants in it but that's the sculpture anyway yeah again I think it's
1:22:05
just it's evolving nicely I know it's taken a while and you're being very patient with us thank you but I think
1:22:11
these now these finer details are going to you know kind of become more important especially at such a prominent
1:22:17
quarter um so um anything uh from our traffic
1:22:27
consultant while you're
1:22:36
here there you go good evening Ken wora Craton man and Engineering traffic consultant for the planning board uh no
1:22:44
uh we have uh reviewed subsequent submissions and um all of our comments
1:22:49
have been addressed to date uh our last comment letter just reiterated the conference call that we had with do uh
1:22:56
in the end of uh November yeah
1:23:03
okay anything else
1:23:10
board applicant if I may Mr chairman I think oh oh Jennifer's waving something
1:23:15
you what so sorry at your December meeting you
1:23:20
did direct preparation of a part two e um to be prepared for this meeting so
1:23:26
that was prepared and circulated um I don't know if you want to go through that or if that's just something you
1:23:33
want to review on your own time and come back with comments um but it has been
1:23:39
prepared one thing I want to note um and this relates to
1:23:45
classification um so this particular project was classified as an unlisted
1:23:50
action uh when we first started almost a year ago a little over a year ago um in November of last year
1:24:00
uh the office of parks recreation and historic preservation has determined that the High Street Tomkins Avenue
1:24:07
historic district is now eligible for listing on the national register of historic places it hasn't been placed on
1:24:15
the national register but it's been determined to be eligible for placement what that does from a sec perspective is
1:24:22
um in the type one classification list there's a category
1:24:28
that says that for any unlisted action that
1:24:33
basically um exceeds 25% of any of the type one
1:24:40
thresholds then that unlisted action becomes a type one action so here we
1:24:46
have an unlisted action um we have a site that is nearby or adjacent or even
1:24:53
I think partially within the High Street Tomkins Avenue historic district which
1:24:59
has now been determined to be eligible so this we now have to apply um some of the thresholds are uh
1:25:07
one of the thresholds is 200 residential units to be connected to Public Water and Sewer any a municipality having
1:25:15
150,000 people or less um you take 25% of that you get 50 units this project is
1:25:21
proposing 64 so it exceeds 20 25% of that type one threshold 14 units and
1:25:28
we're we're next to an eligible historic district so long story not so
1:25:34
short this uh unlisted action is has now been classified as a type one action
1:25:41
this doesn't change your review really from a substantive standpoint you're still doing your hard look you're still
1:25:47
reviewing everything that we've been reviewing um we will want to make sure that we're we're taking an eye to this
1:25:53
his district and making sure that as we would have before that there's um nothing with respect to this project
1:26:00
that is interfering with or negatively impacting that District um but for a
1:26:08
type one action we just need to make sure we're doing a coordinated review which we are and um we're using a full
1:26:16
environmental assessment form rather than the short which we are so we've met those procedural requirements there's
1:26:21
some additional noticing once you've rendered your secer determination but we're not there yet um and you don't
1:26:29
have to worry about that yeah that's helpful thank you yeah so just as far as reviewing this I know you have the draft
1:26:37
um I I would almost prefer that we well there's two things one it's the review
1:26:43
of this material I would prefer that we do take the month review come back to talk more in detail about it next month
1:26:50
and then um we do have a history especially on impactful projects of
1:26:56
holding secret public hearings so at the very least what I think we can talk about is potentially um calendaring a
1:27:04
secret public hearing for next month if you're amable to that um and if I could also note I know
1:27:12
we've been doing Secret public hearings separately from site plan and subdivision right yes um on applications
1:27:19
that involve subdivision because of this anomaly case out of the Department I
1:27:24
won't get into the details but there's this potential requirement out there that you need to complete secra before
1:27:31
you open a subdivision public hearing right y um in practice our secret public
1:27:37
hearings tend to just be a public hearing on the whole project right I mean members of the public are are not
1:27:44
going to they NE they don't necessar limit right so if we wanted to we could
1:27:49
open a public hearing on SE and also the site plan and hold off on the
1:27:54
subdivision public hearing until you've made your secret determination but at least then you've got the site plan
1:28:01
public hearing I think that that's probably appropriate yeah and again who
1:28:07
who knows whether that distinction will be absorbed by the public but I think
1:28:12
for the purposes of tying the secret public hearing to something substantive relative and the site plan I believe is
1:28:19
is ready at this point so um yeah I think um any thoughts on that matter
1:28:26
around the board makes sense to me yeah okay okay and to L's point if I may Mr chairman I
1:28:33
mean it as far as a subdivision it's a lot merger I'll I'll still I'll reiterate you know from your earlier your work session that should the board
1:28:39
decide to let the city council know that they could amend the zoning and make lot line removals or mergers not
1:28:46
subdivisions we'd really appreciate that but this this is only a subdivision because it's a lot merger it's like it's
1:28:52
like um declaring a negative de like it's Contra it sounds contradictory
1:28:57
but exactly it's a lot merger subdivision a lot merger lot line removal before I forget I wanted to make
1:29:03
one more note um because of that change with the historic district you should submit a updated eaf part one okay just
1:29:10
noting that right St District yeah and I'm certain also as a part of the secra
1:29:17
review part of our hard look is in fact traffic and we've discussed traffic quite a bit um so we will continue to
1:29:25
revisit this um as a part of our squet review yeah uh did you have something I
1:29:31
have a question for Jennifer actually um in the work book of the secra um there's a
1:29:40
section that is discussing um like impacts whether they're direct or
1:29:45
indirect impacts of a project and in the listing under the direct impacts um it
1:29:53
includes traffic noise and also alteration of visual character um but in
1:30:00
I was having difficulty finding the section of the um eaf where the visual
1:30:08
character other than like where things are designated a Scenic byway so is
1:30:14
there some other hook that we can put the alteration of Vis visual character
1:30:21
on so your right it's it's aesthetic resources is the the um category and
1:30:30
under aesthetic resources it really is focused on a uh views from public places
1:30:37
not from private property and also impact to views that have been designated as important either through
1:30:43
your lwrp or or otherwise um when you deal with Community
1:30:50
character impacts those are a little bit more uh squishy squishy yes squishy um you
1:30:59
define that secret
1:31:04
term um and if you look at now I'm trying to remember if it's under
1:31:10
consistency with Community plans or consistency with Community character but the last two questions in the EF part
1:31:15
two um there are references to like your comp plan um and your zoning and that's
1:31:23
that's really what kind of defines that Community character so those are the documents that you'd want to look at so
1:31:30
that the comp plan would be the hook do that analysis the yeah and as well this is in the linkage it is in the linkage
1:31:38
distri so that that also as a part of the comprehensive plan would set parameters for some of the um Community
1:31:46
character design standards right the design standards but also then the historic district like proximity does
1:31:54
that so that's a whole other category that's um number 10 impact to Historic and archaeological resources so there
1:32:02
you're looking at um the compatibility of the project with its adjacency to
1:32:08
that historic district and are there any direct conflicts thank you
1:32:16
yep okay so then we can um discuss a motion for
1:32:25
um scheduling a secret and sight plan public hearing for uh the month of
1:32:31
February or otherwise uh accept a motion to do so motion by Len second second by
1:32:40
Karen all in favor I I thank you thank you all right okay so
1:32:47
we will go to our second agenda item uh which is the continued review of applications
1:32:55
for site plan approval and subdivision approval mixed use commercial use and residential 420 430 Fishkill Avenue
1:33:01
submitted by DK HHH realy LLC hello happy wolf Moon uh it is it's
1:33:08
the full moon it's amazing the Moon is incredible it was more yesterday but
1:33:13
anyhow uh for the record Taylor Palmer with cud and fader on behalf of the applicant tonight I am joined by Chris raphaeli our project architect as well
1:33:19
as Dan kler who forgot that it was not November it's actually January uh as well as our traffic consultant Rich D
1:33:25
Andrea from cers uh I'm also joined by the applicant Jay and Dyan Hy as you
1:33:31
mentioned Mr chairman uh we are before you this evening in connection with our continued site plan review uh to
1:33:36
adaptively use the building for a proposed Duncan coffee house uh an accessory drive-through together with first floor commercial space and three
1:33:42
residential units on the second floor in a minute I will turn it over to Chris uh and Dan to go over some of the updates
1:33:48
to our site plan in response to the board's comments and of course those of the Consultants uh as we did uh more
1:33:55
fully detail in our January uh 2nd supplemental submission thank you Mercedes uh some of the updates include
1:34:01
adding additional pedestrian crosswalk uh to connect the potential future rail trail uh to the building removing some
1:34:07
of the parking from uh the front of the building enhancements to our patio area
1:34:13
we did of course refine the facade to be fully Beacon brick throughout that and we updated the corus um based on
1:34:18
comments from the board uh we also um uh
1:34:24
create a connection from the connection or future connection trail to the building just again trying to create
1:34:30
safety and operations uh through the site crosswalks Etc um to try and do that we did also update our lighting
1:34:36
plan uh and in a minute Dan will actually walk you through uh fresh hot off the press uh Deborah adamson's uh
1:34:42
Landscaping plan uh or at least draft working draft of that I know she the word I was looking for before when
1:34:48
speaking with Jennifer was Vision boarded uh sort of a sent a letter to the board representing that but we'll
1:34:54
certainly go through that uh with you all uh and and I believe Mr W said had a comment last month with sort of trying
1:34:59
to get some better definition about our you know patented trademarked uh registered term of sidewalk banking what
1:35:06
that means along the property's frontage so we're certainly uh welcome to further defining that to the extent the board uh
1:35:12
sees fit with that uh I'll turn it to uh Mr ker to walk through some of the site
1:35:17
plan changes and then I can have uh Chris show the pretty pictures thanks Taylor
1:35:26
beard looks good then don't let him don't let him make you
1:35:34
feel you got some work to do I'm
1:35:40
flustered I don't have a problem with that um so Taylor really hit it all um
1:35:46
in terms of some of the things we tried to capture with regard to the discussions previously as this as this
1:35:52
is has evolved now since we've been here a number of times um definitely Tred to
1:35:58
work The Pedestrian accessways throughout the site um accentuating the
1:36:05
fact that there's that 13t area between the white line and the uh and the curb along Fishkill Avenue uh Clean Slate for
1:36:13
whatever Corridor might uh the corridor uh committee might come up with there
1:36:19
um relocated tenant parking Clos to the building entrance uh for the residential
1:36:26
portion tried to make more outdoor space uh by removing the parking that was in
1:36:32
front of the building um you know enhancing the park a bit and um as Taylor mentioned we had we
1:36:40
have submitted a lighting plan and now Deborah Adamson has come up with uh the plan that's before you here obviously we
1:36:48
don't expect you to be able to kind of follow along with what it is but it just gives you some Gra graic representation
1:36:54
of of of where she wants to put some planting with regard into the park areas
1:37:01
and the screening along the roadway and trying to make it so that it's a something that's not blocking sight
1:37:07
lines as you're coming in and out of the site but also really softening the site from Fishkill Avenue trying to hide some
1:37:14
of the parking with with some of the planting along uh the fronts of the parking spaces and Etc so we've got some
1:37:21
mixture of trees shrubs Evergreen uh mixtures a lot of flowering
1:37:27
type of of um Concepts here so basically
1:37:32
uh this is just some of the pallet that she's uh looking to put in here uh
1:37:39
really necessary for me to go through all but where where is that colored drawing and these drawings in the
1:37:45
package yeah that's what I meant it was it literally fresh off the press I didn't want to didn't expect you to uh
1:37:52
you know be able to follow it just I was just trying to give a quick idea of where she's at right now she had
1:37:58
submitted a narrative of what she thought yeah that that I see yeah and so
1:38:05
so this is the first development of it I see okay so that will have submitted in the next package so we have time to
1:38:11
review it yep yeah because again it was you it was good to know I know Deborah I think we all do um she does a very good
1:38:18
job so it's good to know she's um on board and putting some thought to the landscape because that's
1:38:23
going to be an important component to this I was just going to say that from what she submitted what we were able to
1:38:29
review it'd be nice to be able to now start to put that in context and sounds like that's what you're doing part of what we're doing Mr chairman if I may is
1:38:35
trying to embody we know there's been a lot of positive feedback from the fisal Avenue committee and of course your board spent a great deal of time on the
1:38:42
397 fiscal Avenue property across the street so incorporating Deborah and of course the brick facade that Chris will get into is trying to create a lot of
1:38:49
synergy to the extent practical and possible with this site as an existing building versus a new building
1:38:54
to kind of create those so this is a little bit more of an urbanized side but to the extent you know de's trying to
1:39:00
work those two projects to kind of marry some of those Landscaping Concepts so that will certainly be explained more
1:39:06
fully but we wanted to make sure you had it um you know knowing that we're trying to put all these things uh you know in
1:39:11
concert with your comments and of course what's in the corridor yep good thank
1:39:17
you and we've gone a little bit further along with the utilities but obviously we want to make sure that we nail down
1:39:23
the the layout before we do full grading and utilities and and so um I'll turn it
1:39:29
over to Chris actually uh do you want to control this
1:39:35
here these are your three tabs there that's fine yeah that's fine
1:39:42
thanks uh good evening Chris rapael Studio architecture uh so uh with the
1:39:47
input for the last couple of meetings we have um evolved the design of this building um it's mostly entirely brick
1:39:56
now we've accentuated some of the black um features from that we discussed
1:40:01
last time we have uh provided a a profile for what we think the cornice
1:40:07
around the top might be uh the stairwell H the glass around the stairwell has been removed and replaced with uh glass
1:40:15
on the upper Parts it's also been overall has the elevation of it has been lowered uh the the items that are
1:40:22
specific specific to Duncan have been limited to uh The Branding at the
1:40:28
sign uh they're there runs on Duncan uh board and then around the
1:40:44
back just at the drive-thru those are kind of the
1:40:50
features okay um thank you anything else you want to
1:40:56
share
1:41:04
or yeah I so there wasn't much in the way of traffic updates on this I think
1:41:09
our traffic report hasn't changed the parking numbers haven't changed uh since the last review the only thing I think
1:41:16
that was specifically that hasn't been mentioned um was that we did add some pedestrian warning signage to the plan
1:41:24
on uh fish kill Avenue um I know there was a question about whether that should be a rectangular rapid flashing Beacon
1:41:30
sign that's pedestrian activated it flashes um we just didn't see that given
1:41:36
the uncertainty of what's Happening along Fishkill Avenue in the future that
1:41:42
that made sense to install at this point because the placement of that could
1:41:47
change depending on how things work in the That Sidewalk Bank area
1:41:53
and unfortunately those are installed on concrete B bases and so it's it's more involved to relocate that than our
1:41:59
typical sign so at this point it just didn't seem to make sense to install those um other than that I mean there's
1:42:08
some we did reopen that southerly access it seemed to be something that the board
1:42:13
seemed to be in favor of at the last meeting but we can discuss that um because I know there's some comments on
1:42:19
whether that not that's makes the most sense um but otherwise I think everything else is pretty much
1:42:25
consistent okay TR wise yeah so let's let's talk about there's a few things we
1:42:31
want to cover obviously and I don't necessarily want to repeat I know that the U employee or not employee but the
1:42:38
um residential residential parking is something we're going to talk about a little bit um but also let's just let's
1:42:45
just kind of go work backwards just in terms of the um aesthetic um and some of
1:42:51
the modifications that you've all made to the building um and how you're treating the
1:42:57
materiality and again thank you we appreciate your patience with us and for listening
1:43:03
um I'm curious do you happen to have the last iteration just so because I kind of
1:43:09
remember it and um it's its Evolution I can understand
1:43:16
why you would you would maybe think that gravitating to Al brick would be something we would resp respond better
1:43:23
to but I'm not so sure about that especially the um the stair feature cuz
1:43:29
there was there was a lightness to that and there was an ability of that to sort of break up these volumes that I
1:43:38
preferred better um for glass or just a lighter
1:43:43
material let me see if I can pull it up from my there there was something about the that element being glass um yeah it
1:43:50
was glass last time yeah it was all glass last is what we that's right yeah yeah yeah it just it just this looks
1:43:57
very kind of heavy and monolithic now so if you would consider going back to the glass that may be a little bit and again
1:44:05
this is just one board member's opinion yeah I do think also the having
1:44:10
lowered it is it helps well no I I think it needs to be so between
1:44:17
your last iteration and this one it needs to be somewhere in between in between yeah cuz two dominent in the
1:44:23
previous version in terms of its height but a little too squished here in this version so I don't know if there's a if
1:44:31
if if there's you know an arbitrary point is appropriate it doesn't seem like there's anything programmatically
1:44:38
that would you know determine what that height would be it's it's basically the proportions right yeah so it seems like
1:44:46
uh in this version the two cornices between the stair Tower and the Upper Floor kind of a bit of in Conflict so
1:44:52
maybe the the change of material on the stair Tower would help that without changing the elevation maybe yeah yeah
1:45:00
again it it may end up being if you do go back to Glass which I would personally prefer the height of it may
1:45:07
be dictated by the volume of the um the modules right but also I wouldn't mind
1:45:13
seeing you know the top module reduce just as kind of you know sort of natural
1:45:18
order of things so yeah I just work work the balance there um
1:45:24
but otherwise um you know I prefer you know I appreciate the profile on the
1:45:32
corners that's fine oh yeah there's the old one
1:45:37
yeah yeah and you know I don't I don't necessarily I don't know what do you
1:45:44
think the the change in color I think the black is fine on the on the cornice element I think it it just adds
1:45:51
consistency and it seems it relates to the it relates to the lower band above
1:45:59
the um the fenestration at the at the first level and then we did carry brick
1:46:05
through I mean this obviously showing we did carry the brick through the Duncan sort of portion of it yeah yeah no I
1:46:11
that is that's fine I think so yeah
1:46:23
what else just in terms of the aesthetic let's cover that and then we'll go to our Consultants I think the the Brick is
1:46:31
an improvement having one unified material it's less busy uh I I have to
1:46:37
agree with you John about the uh the the feature of of of that vertical element
1:46:42
breaking it up the one thing I might suggest is when I looked at the original
1:46:48
building that there's a wall there that exists said you would have to uh demo in order
1:46:55
to make it all glass right if you're increasing the height from the existing roof you actually could increase that uh
1:47:02
uh build that out of um uh you know thermal storefront something like that it's not very difficult to do in some
1:47:09
way that uh highlighted it as a as a tower and also lit up the stair so it
1:47:16
was a little bit more interesting wouldn't be that difficult to do and it would serve the purpose that you were talking about but that's just a one
1:47:23
suggestion there are other ways to do that and there's you know it's but yeah so as far as the extent of glass are we
1:47:29
talking about four sides the front and left I I think there's a couple ways you
1:47:35
could do it one of them just be the top would be glass right so it be a tower with just a ring of Glass on the top
1:47:42
right that it's one option the other way would be to have the outside corner be
1:47:47
glass right and that would be a feature and it would just be the corner the other way is that you can have it on two or three sides right and I think
1:47:55
there's the intent the basic intent is what John was talking about was like having like two masses they're different
1:48:01
things and then like this intermediary third element that pulls it together it's it's not much effort and I think it
1:48:09
um um it does improve the composition it's kind of almost like um uh well
1:48:16
anyway and the other thing is the Duncan element right that signage it's iconic
1:48:21
it's whatever and I don't have a problem with that being like um
1:48:27
this you know uh bright signage thing on top of something that is more uniform I
1:48:34
don't think it's a I I think it's actually okay it makes that signage which is required and the color scheme
1:48:40
and all that other stuff um uh sort of uh it improves its performance as a sign
1:48:48
because it's on a sort of blank background it's not on a busy background you know and uh it's
1:48:56
so that's just my and also I really appreciate putting this parking in the back I think it'll improve the
1:49:02
performance of it as a space to be used it'll it'll be a better Dunkin Donuts because people do use those outside
1:49:08
spaces and uh and also it'll look much better great thanks anyone else just as
1:49:16
in terms of the architecture uh I too appreciate the um simplification of the
1:49:22
facade material cial and I agree with John and the um the tower element that
1:49:29
joins the two can um be of a different you know more glass go back to Glass
1:49:36
yeah although this one this new version has a clock too seems to be a theme you're copying we're all going to know
1:49:42
what time it is or they're all going to be the wrong time it's the other it's the other corner of
1:49:48
being the booket Great
1:49:53
um let's go to our Consultants Natalie yeah um I can start
1:49:59
so this is in relation to the the tenant only parking right there's um I think we
1:50:05
reduced from four to three residential units or is it sorry three units it's three units I'm mixing I'm mixing
1:50:11
projects now um so three residential units and my comment at the last meeting
1:50:18
was um the there are designated spaces for the residents which I think is a is a smart move um they were previously
1:50:25
over by kind of the open space access to the Future rail trail which again also
1:50:31
really appreciate that future access being provided and my comment at the on my last letter was that the residents
1:50:38
who would be parked there would have to kind of cross over multiple Lanes of parking that don't really have um there
1:50:45
wasn't a crosswalk there wasn't a sidewalk there wasn't like a break so they'd be kind of walking through parked vehicles and then also the exit portion
1:50:53
of the of the drive-thru so my comment from the last letter was um Can internal
1:51:00
walkways or Crossings be added to the site plan to facilitate safer pedestrian circulation to the site I think the move
1:51:07
that was made is um I see the intent cuz I the parking
1:51:12
that's now residential parking is parallel on that um on the southern side
1:51:18
right which is closer to the portion of the building that is going to hold the residential units um even though the
1:51:24
entrance will be on the front side not on that side M so I get the part of the
1:51:29
intent of why that was done but I I think ultimately it makes the situation less safe for those folks exiting those
1:51:36
cars whether they're the residents or their Duncan um customers or folks I
1:51:43
think it's office or retail so anyone who's parking in those four parallel spaces has to cross over the driveway
1:51:51
that's coming directly in on the south side now that kind of connects to the bypass lane then they also have to cross
1:51:57
over the the drive-thru Lane and they're doing that right at a kind of a corner of a building so right where those cars
1:52:03
are turning around so I'm just concerned that that creates um creates more safety issues
1:52:10
than it solves with that so I think um and speaking with the aath and trying to
1:52:16
think about alternatives for that um you know I I think the AL the the
1:52:22
solution that was I hate that we're keep we're going back to things but the solution that was there previously of
1:52:28
the residential parking being marked being on the Northern side but just having direct having better connection
1:52:33
to the building is safer than them having to cross over these these access Lanes um I think there was the
1:52:41
discussion of potentially making the front parking spaces residential but I agree with Kevin's comment that the
1:52:47
creation of that Plaza in an Ideal World this building would be all the way up to to the front
1:52:53
you know looking at 397 talking about that building and why that was so successful the building was up to the
1:52:59
front of the parsel line you can't do that here because you're adaptively reusing an existing building where it is we already have the drive-thru Lane
1:53:06
cutting across the front of the building so I agree with the removal of that that parking there that could have been
1:53:12
another alternative for the tenant only parking but I think ultimately with the spaces that are left I think for safety
1:53:17
reasons and maybe I don't know if Ken has more comments on that that I think for pedestrian safety the location
1:53:23
they're at right now doesn't make sense right that offers a good opportunity too for shared parking I know there's a
1:53:28
comment also in your memorandum about the laat so there's that because the residents typically won't be there in
1:53:33
sort of complimentary times to an extent yeah yeah yeah I just think about if you
1:53:39
know as as a potential resident like this it it would seem sort of
1:53:46
awkward to get out of your car especially in a lane where there's people coming at you from behind um um
1:53:52
and then Crossing you know traffic waiting in line it just seem it feels we appreciate that and I think that will
1:53:58
probably be I think in the next iteration and I certainly dandre to speak to that will probably become just loading area um exclusively so I think
1:54:05
you know that's we don't this we don't need right there not the right word we like but we don't need the spaces so to speak we were trying to we really just
1:54:11
trying to create connections so we understand better the comment now about what the function is there um yeah and I
1:54:18
agree with don't don't ever go back to putting it in the front because I agree I think that that you know sort of free area the
1:54:24
plaza area is a nice touch um so and that kind of relates
1:54:31
back to the Loading area um I think the solution when thinking about making this the residential parking over there we
1:54:37
lost the loading area and the idea was that loading could happen in the evening hours kind of in the Drive-Thru Lane
1:54:42
when the business isn't open again I thought that just that maybe causes more conflicts with the residential tenants
1:54:49
having evening or nighttime loading um so I I think what it sounds like is it's
1:54:54
an easy enough solution to go back to the Loading area being on that side so there's designated loading area not only
1:55:00
for Duncan and the other commercial spaces but also tenants moving in needing a space where they can kind of
1:55:06
access to move in for moving vehicles and stuff like that
1:55:13
um entrance only driveway um now used to be just delivery so maybe that goes back
1:55:18
to just deliveries I'm not sure uh but I think in this iteration what we're seeing now it had opened up to all
1:55:25
traffic um and we had lost the ballards on that most southern portion of the building separating the Escape lane from
1:55:32
the drive-thru so I think that opened up one of Ken's previous comments about folks kind of maybe using that southern
1:55:38
driveway to kind of cut into the drive-through line rather than going to the in In-N-Out one and then kind of
1:55:44
winding around so just thinking about that maneuvering um this is not in the code
1:55:51
so this is just kind of looking at you know as someone who drives an EV and and looking at what the city of Beacon is
1:55:57
trying to do in terms of adding that as amenities and we have so much parking on this site whether a charging station um
1:56:05
would be possible I think both either for residents um or folks stopping at Duncan or stopping for the rail trail or
1:56:11
the laundry M you know I think that could be a nice addition uh requesting one more bench as
1:56:17
someone who regularly uses laundry mats you I love to sit outside but also want
1:56:22
to be able to watch my machines so I I don't know if that's me being paranoid or not so like a bench you you're
1:56:29
providing parking which I think is awesome because the fishal Avenue committee is having some issues with with the parking that's happening at the
1:56:35
laundry mat so I think that's a great addition and nice shared parking if we could have one more bench closer to the
1:56:40
laundry mat I think that if we are going to have that shared parking that allows um folks waiting for the laundry to
1:56:47
actually kind of use that that space a little bit more and then there was a number number of questions for the
1:56:53
lighting plan that I think you said um team's going to go over the lighting plan so those questions could be
1:56:58
addressed kind of just proposed hours um whether there's dimmers um it looks like
1:57:03
there's some really tall um poles right now that it looks like they're being reduced so just kind
1:57:09
of clarifying that um eliminated actually eliminated okay so on the
1:57:15
removal all all the poles are new all the poles are new but they're kind of in the same location
1:57:20
no okay okay um and so they're on the demo plan
1:57:26
is being removed yeah the red sign REM okay oh I missed that
1:57:33
um and then there's the requirements in the code for lighting that I didn't necessarily see stated there in your
1:57:39
Luminaire schedule in terms of color temperature okay um color
1:57:46
rendering and then um noting full cut off the code was
1:57:52
a little bit unclear cuz it talks about 90° angles but then requires full cut off so we had said you had said cut off
1:57:58
in your materials just wanted to make sure that was full cut off I added the diagram there for the planning board because I know we talked previously
1:58:04
about what does that actually mean I think we had that same discuss on the temple too yeah um Landscaping plan
1:58:12
we'll have to review that and I I'll just explain my comment number eight about the crosswalk and having the rapid
1:58:19
Beacon there is we do have a un signalize Crossing further down on
1:58:24
fishco Avenue that um The fishco Avenue committee has heard a lot of complaints
1:58:30
about even though there is a sign in the middle that says pedestrian Crossing and there is a blinking light that folks
1:58:35
drive unsafely through that um and it makes it uncomfortable for pedestrians to cross so just thinking about that I
1:58:42
you know I agree that it's hard at this point to kind of think about where you're going to be putting materials um not knowing what's happening with the
1:58:48
corridor but uh that's my only concern about having that un signalized Crossing there if it's just paint on the ground
1:58:55
uh vehicles on this Corridor don't really tend to pay attention to that right now that was it for my
1:59:01
comments Rich could you do one of the solar flashing pedestrian signs in that area
1:59:07
still would be on a concrete base so if the the problem that you come in run
1:59:13
into is placement of it within respect to where the crossing or like if there's
1:59:19
a sidewalk there in the future let's say on our side the placement of that has is supposed to
1:59:24
be theoretically for ADA compliance within a certain distance of the crosswalk so if we place that right now
1:59:30
the only place to put it would be on the private property and if the sidewalk goes in and it's further than that
1:59:37
certain distance it's not technically not need compliant for push button to activate the crosswalk so it's not
1:59:42
really a question of whether it's solar or not I I just I was thinking more of
1:59:47
like a notification ahead um of crosswalks or whatever else I've seen some small solar signs that are do like
1:59:55
the the same warning sign as like a consistent linking sign you have the the blink it's not a rapid flashing Beacon
2:00:02
but it's a blinker it's got lights around the edges of the sign it's not pedestrian activated it would right
2:00:07
blink flashes every yeah right but I've seen those solar wise so that yeah that
2:00:14
those we could look at doing something like that I mean is that something that might I I think anything that draws more
2:00:20
attention to a learning driver is that you you're potentially going to get people crossing there um helps some
2:00:31
agree any um anything review of your comments John any additional um there
2:00:36
there several that are forthcoming as the plans uh develop further along um
2:00:44
one thing they ought to look at is uh they may need to uh have a grease trap
2:00:50
on site um that I would talk with the building department about what size are you going
2:00:56
to need where that's going to be located how that connects to the sanitary system
2:01:02
um it may be an internal one I don't know U but that needs to be looked at um where do you stand with your agreements
2:01:09
with Metro North good question so we did actually hear back from them uh yesterday um so they apologized there's
2:01:15
some I guess more developments in the the world of rail Trails um so they did say that they're going to get back to us
2:01:21
you know in the coming weeks but we've been for the benefit of the board um the public we originally contacted them
2:01:27
regarding the carvana application but anticipating this application included both properties so that whole area is
2:01:34
being sought for conveyance or in the alternative of license agreement permanent license agreement so like I
2:01:39
don't know the I don't know the spoiler of what the further the new uh developments in the rail trail business
2:01:45
are but they identified that as being like the the reason for the delay and getting back to us so the reason I asked
2:01:51
that Taylor is uh the plans are now showing a 6in discharge pipe which I believe to be roof leaders in their
2:01:58
property so that's and they right to to the extent they may comment on that or we'd have to adj like you said adjust it
2:02:04
right so but we have we have sought to have that conveyed uh to the applicant okay
2:02:12
so it's just some other minor cleanup stuff that has to be okay um Ken anything you'd like to
2:02:18
add uh certainly a majority of our comments have been addressed and I appreciate the
2:02:24
uh the updates provided and I know one of them had to do with a dead end area
2:02:30
in uh in front of the store cars would come down there and if the parking was full they would have to like 3 point
2:02:37
four point turn their way around to come back out so that's back open and allows for kind of a circular uh circulation
2:02:43
through there um if the laundromat is going to use some of the parking over here on the edge there may just need to
2:02:50
be some little pedestrian connection ction it might just be like two Pap stones or something it's it's probably
2:02:55
from here to here that they would have to to cross you know to get to it um
2:03:01
wherever the loading dock or loading area winds up you'll want to coordinate
2:03:07
the curb ramp for the dolly you know to get up onto that sidewalk and into uh
2:03:12
the delivery areas through there and I understand the you know sidewalk Bank
2:03:17
area that's kind of to be determined as um the committee discusses that more um
2:03:23
and relative to the crosswalk across fish kill Avenue going further down is
2:03:29
just paint it's just a sign in the middle of the road if here that treatment is a little bit different I
2:03:34
would think about just kind of a comprehensive use of the different devices the simplest one is just pain in
2:03:41
the middle of the road step it up with some signage in the road on the sides
2:03:47
step it up even more and you're getting into Electronics flashing lights you know beacons
2:03:52
you can even go so far as um they're being beacons but they are pedestrian
2:03:57
activated so they're not on 24 hours and it's 1:00 a.m. and hey people you know drivers get used to being driving
2:04:04
through there and there's no pedestrians here I'm just going to go through it uh to a control system where like a
2:04:11
pedestrian push button they won't get a three-color signal to walk but they can push the button and then the signal or
2:04:16
then the signs light up and says there is a pedestrian here so there's multiple different levels of improvement or
2:04:24
awareness that you can step up through there and that may be part of the discussion of the Fishkill
2:04:30
Avenue thank you appreciate it anything else any questions or uh any
2:04:37
further comments or notes for the applicant from the board yeah go ahead I have a question on can you walk through
2:04:43
the how many cars you expect to be lined up at the um takeout window on peak
2:04:50
hours or peak times and how far the line
2:04:56
wraps around I'm not yeah so the the peak cue that we've seen based on
2:05:04
observations of other existing Duncan facilities is approximately 12 Vehicles
2:05:10
so that's what we kind of plan for if if we hit that 12 Vehicles it would basically wrap around to the front of
2:05:16
the building right before it kind of comes back in or like right at where it comes back in towards the the building
2:05:24
if that makes sense I yeah like right in there right so that's B basically and
2:05:30
that diagram is in our traffic study if you take a look at it but that's basically where the 12 Vehicles would
2:05:35
lead you to and how much time of the day do you expect to have that that's
2:05:40
probably you know a a couple times Occurrence at best for a 10-minute
2:05:46
period or something like that in the morning and that's the only time you're going to you're going to really see that I mean
2:05:52
you may see cues of nine Vehicles which may get you to the the corner of the building there um more regularly but
2:05:59
that's what we're what we're talking about so how many cars could you fit from the driveth through window back to
2:06:07
the corner where you know the southern entrance meets the drive-thru Lane
2:06:13
that's probably 9 or 10 Vehicles okay so that whole front drive through Lane um
2:06:22
is for like two or three cars for a couple of minutes a
2:06:29
day probably okay is there any way that we can look at accommodating the need um
2:06:36
and not having a whole drive-thru Lane along the front of the the
2:06:42
building yeah I mean again this this goes back to you know what do you do in those situations where we do have more
2:06:51
than nine Vehicles right and that's where you have if you have that that other driveway and that's the way in
2:06:58
that's other than driveway our vehicle is going to be queuing back onto onto fishal Avenue which is something we
2:07:04
wouldn't want there's other ways to handle that internally that maybe we could designate some spaces for um for
2:07:12
drive-thru pickup where if the queue gets too long they can direct people to go to those spaces the problem that we
2:07:18
run into there is now if we're talking about removing the four spaces on the Southside putting the loading space back
2:07:23
in how do we pick up the spaces that we need to accommodate two additional Reserve
2:07:29
spaces um we're running into a situation where we're kind of running out of space for
2:07:34
parking rich I have a question so that South entrance is that going to be right turn in only or is it right and left
2:07:39
turn in well I guess it depends on what we end up with with the removing that
2:07:46
parking and putting the loading space back in if we put the loading space back
2:07:51
again and we make that deliveries only again then my thinking is that that driveway becomes deliveries only and it
2:07:58
has a separate treatment so that it doesn't look like it can be traversed by Passenger otherwise you're going to get people trying to cut the line no agreed
2:08:05
so my thinking is if we go back to what we had on the previous plan where that's deliveries only it becomes a separate
2:08:10
treatment maybe it's uh grass papers maybe it's a mountable area that the trucks can Traverse over I'm not sure we
2:08:17
can think about what that looks like but the idea being that it looks like something that cars aren't going to drive over yeah and
2:08:24
and and more importantly if cars do think that that's a we in not necessarily you know the issue of
2:08:30
cutting the line but it could create a backup there well that's that's what I was looking at and I think what Karen
2:08:36
was looking at is do we need to have that paved Lane across the front um right the one the one running
2:08:43
east west running across the front of the building and if that was the entrance specifically just for the
2:08:50
drive-thru you've got the drive-through Lane the bypass lane could you make it a double drive-thru Lane that merges
2:08:57
together so that you're bringing the traffic off of Fishkill Avenue and merging
2:09:03
them we'd have to talk to Duncan about that typically when you have a double
2:09:08
drive-thru Lane you would have two order boards no but I'm saying it could be two that merge into a single lane and then
2:09:14
comes up to a single single order board because my concern would be the
2:09:19
vehicle's back or queuing on fish kill Avenue and then creating a hazard out
2:09:25
there we can we can look at it I mean I think yeah we we'll take a look at it I
2:09:32
it's just I'm just trying to figure out interaction of if there's two lanes of queuing there if we do get delivery that
2:09:38
happens at the same time how does that work you know right and how do people bypass and I guess as unpopular as it
2:09:44
may sound there is some advantage to having that lane come across the front and that is if
2:09:51
if an individual is last in line and sees a long line there's relief you can
2:09:57
either go park or just turn around the parking lot and leave right so it's it's
2:10:03
a visual Q too and it it does it does potentially and that's why that's why we
2:10:09
have that bypass lane around the drivethru also is that if if that's the case somebody wants to get out of the
2:10:14
drive-thru Lane they can go park without having being delayed right it some somewhat alleviates this this potential
2:10:21
for backup onto fish 52 yeah my my my personal opinion is the cleanest way
2:10:28
this works is if it's that driveway that southern driveway is deliveries only I agree and you have the front that front
2:10:35
driveway right I agree and again it's not it's not optimal to have that front drive I also
2:10:42
think it it existing there the Landscaping treatment is going to be super important yeah agree
2:10:51
but I see I see why you're asking that question I just you it's not lovely it's
2:10:57
not lovely and if it's like for a couple of cars for you know once a day for 10 minutes like there may be some other
2:11:05
alternative that is better okay yeah we'll look at all those options thank
2:11:14
you anything else folks questions comments no I think
2:11:22
I mean as far as that circulation there's been discussions all around it but it just seems like there's got to be a simpler way to resolve all these
2:11:28
issues and I know it's complicated but that's what good design is about is making different they do have
2:11:34
Technologies like line busting and things like that that are like dunk in specific uh for these exact reasons
2:11:39
because typically you don't have as large of a site I think we said that earlier in the presentation to work with when you're dealing with this operation
2:11:46
so you know for getting a bip plastic Lane for example and having the ability to have vehicles pull up into pick up
2:11:52
spaces or to you know if you've ordered the one thing it takes more than 30 seconds to prepare you know they send
2:11:57
you and so we'll bring it out to you so there are ways they can do that they monitor it Duncan and the the the
2:12:03
franchisee has more than 80 locations so they're they understand sort of the functions and how that works how many uh
2:12:10
80 different uh at least 80 different um not just Duncan but multiple other
2:12:16
iterations so to that extent we'll look at that but we will look at the the the sort of duality of the merge and see if
2:12:22
that can be accomplished okay The Duality of the merge it's a dual Lane baby okay all
2:12:29
right so what else can we do for you this evening uh if I may Mr chairman just asked that the board considers setting the public hearing I knew you
2:12:36
were going to ask that um yes let's discuss we at the applicant's request
2:12:45
can consider noticing schedule of public hearing for next month any thoughts by
2:12:50
the board or uh otherwise a motion to do
2:12:55
so motion to schedule a public hearing for next month motion by Len second second by David all in favor I I thank
2:13:04
you thank you see evening are you here for the next one too not tonight at
2:13:10
least okay so next item on the agenda can I be of any more service to you tonight tone um I do not believe you
2:13:19
came thank you very much I know I love it you just jump up and leave actually
2:13:24
listened to all the rules before thank you appreciate you coming down oh and it
2:13:30
was like H Cesar wait next item on the agenda uh number
2:13:35
three continued review of application for site plan approval mixed use commercial and residential 291 Main Street submitted by telephone building
2:13:42
Beacon LLC good evening sir good evening happy New Year you
2:13:48
too thank you um yes so so the first thing that a
2:13:54
question came up at the last meeting that we were at um about whether we could have what's considered two
2:14:01
buildings on the same lot and uh Bruce took a look at that with me and determined that that was um allowed okay
2:14:09
Bruce you can confirm verbally yes yes okay thank you I just
2:14:17
got to keep you honest there AR I know so we we
2:14:23
um we made some significant changes to the building design based on the discussions we had at the last meeting
2:14:30
um instead of the previous approach of treating the addition as a separate neighboring Main Street Building the new
2:14:37
design um relates more to the elements of the telephone building um so there's you know still
2:14:45
commercial on the ground floor a total of three Apartments um the the applicant
2:14:51
took one out in order to you know respond better to um what we were talking about at the last
2:14:57
meeting and um so what we did was that there's a twostory section of the
2:15:04
building in on on Main Street and then when you get back Beyond um where the
2:15:11
existing building steps back the addition pops up to three stories but you you know that so it doesn't
2:15:17
interfere with the Cornus um the the you know reduces the scale of the addition in
2:15:23
relation to the building um it sort of you know quiets that all down um the additions also steep back
2:15:31
from the face of the telephone building by uh I think it's 2 feet or yeah 2 ft
2:15:38
there and and then um there's a continuous you know glazed connection to the existing building so
2:15:45
it kind of lightens up that point of you know where where where they meet
2:15:51
um also at at the interior where they meet we we'd keep the existing brick of
2:15:57
the telephone building so you you'd see that you know sort of through that glass connection
2:16:02
piece um see what
2:16:09
else so so this this is um more reflective of elements of the existing
2:16:15
building but in a little more modern interpretation of it it's almost like another B
2:16:21
um pulled away from the building with that glass connection there there's
2:16:27
a in in terms of the requirements of the district you know the design requirements that there's a upper Cornus
2:16:34
it's a lot simpler um you know part partly because we didn't want to compete
2:16:39
at all with the um that big feature of the telephone building that there's not
2:16:45
a lower corness exactly but what we did was you know we used a little lentil piece similar to lless above the first
2:16:52
floor windows and and door um the window proportions are similar
2:17:00
there's that corner column and stone base which is another interpretation of
2:17:05
what's on the building and and then we're we're using like a gray brick
2:17:11
instead of the red brick so there's another little bit of visual separation there but you similar
2:17:18
material um so and on the
2:17:27
uh on the south Brett side and the building is
2:17:34
um there's parking below the building so we're looking at you know how to landscape that or visually separate that
2:17:40
but um and then there's also a Gable type roof there set back pretty much in
2:17:46
line with the houses on that block um you know so so that is meant to relate a little bit more to the residential
2:17:54
streetcape over there um we have four parking
2:17:59
spaces and then you know I think we're going to have to interpret how the uh new parking regulations apply the you
2:18:07
know there there is a commercial use there's the three residential spaces which you know we're
2:18:13
covering but you know there may be a way to get shared parking there to help it
2:18:19
fit in but I'm but I'm not you we have to look at how the new regulations apply okay um and then also
2:18:28
you know we'll get um photo realistic renderings but I just wanted to get your your take on this new
2:18:36
approach um yeah so my first question is what is this app is this SketchUp you're
2:18:41
using yeah I love that quality um thank you that was just an
2:18:48
aside yeah no I think aesthetically uh this um
2:18:55
is a very nice departure from what we were looking at before I think that um
2:19:01
you know the way that you've you've treated this is well handled and I think the
2:19:07
idea of being able to perceive the brick as you look through that is nice I also
2:19:12
like the way the fact that you've you've paid attention to the sort of relationship of these elements and
2:19:20
started introduce not necessarily copy but introduce these sort of
2:19:26
elements this piece is a little weird I'm I'm just wondering if we can
2:19:32
think about treating that a little differently it just it just seems really out of place at at the top or just the
2:19:39
the I mean I think I think this is fine but I think and I and I I sort of like
2:19:45
the nod here like the the nod to the aesthetic
2:19:50
if somehow this could be treated just a little less loudly for
2:19:57
lack of a better term I don't know maybe study it but
2:20:02
this this is the piece right now that really stands out in addition to the stilts in the back but we'll get to that
2:20:09
but yeah no I think just as in terms of a composition and the relationship of old to new this is beginning to be
2:20:17
handled much nicer than yeah and we'll do um you know the the renderings and be
2:20:23
able to see a lot of that stuff more clearly yeah I again I love the this diagrammatic quality of sketch it but
2:20:29
also think about because this this will be visually prominent this Edge what happens here I wouldn't necessar
2:20:35
necessarily say Go decorative but you know perhaps it's a con continuation continuation of what's What's Happening
2:20:43
Here it does look like you transition materials or some other sort of articulation even if it's just a step
2:20:49
out on the brick and a shadow line I don't know think about it um but uh it
2:20:55
it'll save it from just being this blank wall that terminates and yeah again something could come along and be built
2:21:01
against that and you'll never never know but at least for the time being as long as the car wash is there you'll see it
2:21:07
it'll be pretty prominent okay um it'll be a nice location for Rick price
2:21:14
piece um the stilts I I understand your you're
2:21:20
looking to um Place parking underneath that part of the building
2:21:27
MH um you know and I just I I'm concerned about like I don't know if I
2:21:32
were driving I'd probably smash into one but just their relationship to the
2:21:39
let me find the one yeah their relationship to the perimeter of the building right it looks like it's being
2:21:45
built in a in a severe flood zone yeah I was thinking maybe maybe do more more of
2:21:50
a some kind of like a green wall type of thing that I mean cuz we don't want to
2:21:57
enclose it necessarily but no I'm not necessarily saying enclose it but well first what is this netting well that
2:22:04
that that was some kind of a lattice that that oh I see might have plants growing on it okay yeah I'm just curious
2:22:10
even structurally whether you know the fact that you're holding this up and and these support members are being held off
2:22:17
the edges even if that's practical in terms of the just the structural system but I think
2:22:23
them being set in is a little awkward yeah I think I think they're we're pretty tight with our maneuvering and
2:22:30
and the drive lane so I I think that's the closest I can get it to the edge or just pull the whole thing back in you
2:22:37
know pull pull the building but I I don't think I can move the uh those outer
2:22:43
supports but but I know what you mean you know visually so I'll look at it um why do you have
2:22:49
shingles on the inside that's kind of sketch up yeah um yeah I mean it's
2:22:56
it's it'll prove to be you know somewhat of an interesting composition on that
2:23:01
elevation you know this whole aesthetic I'm not I'm fine with but it's just it's
2:23:08
really the relationship what's happening down here yeah um I I think just for me that's it as
2:23:15
far as the Aesthetics also the the Gable the Gable on the um
2:23:24
I don't know how much you're actually going to see you will see it actually when you're standing in the shop right or
2:23:29
the supermarket parking lot I don't is there a way you can work on the pitch of
2:23:35
this thing yeah just seems super shallow I know you're relating it to the Dormer
2:23:41
pitch on the larger New Edition but yeah I mean there there may be another way to
2:23:47
do that side of the roof there I think if it had a little bit more height to it or I don't know if you even
2:23:54
went flat would make sense I mean yeah if I can get the other one to
2:24:00
work with it if it's flat that that may be a way to go I understand you have those two coming together so yeah I just
2:24:06
that's my only other comment um so let's just stay with the Architectural Review before we go to Consultants just um I
2:24:14
was going to call you all team team board feel I'm back up work any other
2:24:21
comments you covered you covered what my
2:24:26
concerns I I have some some concerns that just are not resolved and I don't know if I can articulate them well but
2:24:34
the the context of this building is that it's sort of prominent and uniquely um separate you know unlike a
2:24:42
lot of other buildings on on Main Street that have adjoining buildings that share a wall um it
2:24:48
doesn't and once you um you know attach an Annex onto it like
2:24:55
this you you kind of um disrupt that context and I wonder if you know are we
2:25:03
really being kind of looking at this critically in terms of does this addition you know preserve does it
2:25:10
complement does it enhance the existing building I feel like this is a precedent setting decision because it's a a
2:25:17
significant change to a landmark designated building
2:25:22
and I'm I want to make sure we have a really solid rationale
2:25:27
for um examining the design of the addition and I'm also a little bit
2:25:33
concerned that once this context of the building is irrevocably Changed by having an addition built onto it that
2:25:41
that might um kind of simplify future decisions if you know if there are if
2:25:46
there are uh situations in the future where more changes are sought to the building that uh future boards or decision makers
2:25:53
might say well the original context of the building in its kind of prom prominence and separateness is now gone
2:26:00
so it makes it easier to approve additional changes to it um I
2:26:06
just I'm having a real hard time with this one because the building is so unique and
2:26:13
um it's just not uh to me it it just doesn't it doesn't
2:26:20
doesn't strike me as really complementing the existing structure in a way that makes me want to
2:26:25
say sure this is um this is is uh is going to enhance it
2:26:33
and preserve it um so I don't know but
2:26:38
that's that's where I'm struggling with it but that's where I'm at Great anything
2:26:46
else on the aesthetic the architecture I'm I'm if if it was up to me I would
2:26:55
have that the uh portion that goes uh to Main Street be one story so that it
2:27:01
maintains that and then um if you
2:27:06
economically can't uh uh make this building pencil out uh by removing one of the units
2:27:14
essentially um I would look into um getting a variance for the 20ft
2:27:21
setback cuz I don't know if the 20ft setback is in um is it maintains the pattern of
2:27:28
residences that are along that street and I don't know what benefit it um uh
2:27:36
uh what benefit it has to the to the to the streetcape right is having that space there you mean the the the rear St
2:27:43
the rear set yeah because I and if you could plan it so that you got three
2:27:49
units change the parking so that you're not there's very a lot of Paving it's very complicated uh parking setup it's
2:27:56
awkward you have to put the building on stilts there's all sorts of things that you have to do in order to make that happen if there's a way
2:28:02
of um making the Main Street storefront
2:28:08
just the storefront right just the one story addition to the existing building
2:28:13
which would really be um uh pull it back visually from the uh it would maintain
2:28:21
that that iconic aspect of that building I I think I'm not sure but I think part of the design standards there uh
2:28:27
two-story minimum I think I'm not positive I was just going to pull that
2:28:34
up well the building itself isn't two stories there's just a one story portion of it in that case right I mean I think
2:28:42
you can interpret it in different ways my point is that any twostory portion no matter how uh elaborate you
2:28:51
articulate it right or imagine that it's going to be transparent or in other ways
2:28:57
it's it's always going to be a visual block no matter where you are across the street on that sidewalk and it's going
2:29:03
to detract from that uh that uh uh three-dimensional aspect of the cornice
2:29:10
that pops out right well I mean I mean I think I think by by you know lowering it
2:29:16
to to this two story you know you definitely see the see the corn is wrapping all all the way around and
2:29:24
um you know I'm I'm I'm FL you know spinning the uh SketchUp model and and
2:29:31
it just didn't seem like it was cutting off you know there certain areas but I
2:29:37
mean you're Al you know if you're walking on the sidewalk you know you have that car wash and then the alley
2:29:44
you know the the alley is not really attractive and it's problematic and and
2:29:51
um you know I I mean I mean I I I understand the potential of maybe the
2:29:57
one story thing there but you know it it would involve a you know
2:30:03
variance and yeah I don't even know if it would work to have to ask for variance there I mean I I just feel like
2:30:10
the only way to maintain the visual uh Integrity of this building is to have
2:30:16
that addition in the front be one story otherwise you're going to block this visually and it's just not going to look it it
2:30:22
will it will uh will diminish the impact of this building significantly no matter how artfully you
2:30:29
do a two-story Edition I I I just think that's that's
2:30:34
it's impossible to maintain um uh with the heights that you're
2:30:41
showing
2:30:52
yeah I mean I can take a look and you see if there's other potential ways to do that but um I mean he's already cut
2:31:00
from four to three Apartments I don't think he can you know lose another one if he can't keep it somewhere
2:31:08
else uh that it's I mean
2:31:14
respectfully it's not we we don't have any intented I mean
2:31:21
there's no reason for us to try to not make viable buildings right but we don't have it's not our responsibility to make
2:31:27
a building uh the have it be the greatest Financial benefit to the owner
2:31:32
right right that's not part of our our mission we're not supposed to do things that are that are uh uh arbitrary or
2:31:40
ridiculous and would prevent it but I
2:31:45
I I think that that is the fundamental um
2:31:51
formal uh you know massing uh part of this that that uh has to be preserved in
2:31:57
order to have it maintain its its uh visual Integrity on the as a part of the
2:32:03
street I can't think of a you I'm trying to think of other um applications we've
2:32:08
had that have have involved some of these kind of issues and to cross street because it extended behind a row of
2:32:14
existing buildings you know almost touched on some of these issues of of
2:32:20
sort of you know involving other landmark buildings and we had very clear
2:32:26
Direction they were going to remove a Cornus element that we asked them to stop on that was uh like above R what
2:32:33
used to be River Winds they were going to take that Medallion and we were like no way you got to put that back they
2:32:38
were concerned it would be a hazard for but um but it wasn't it was a way less
2:32:44
obtrusive um project because it was set back and behind por that's that's part of that
2:32:52
fabric that's just the facades on Main Street the majority of the fabric this is this unique structure right
2:32:59
landmarked that has a unique uh uh uh you know formal presence on this in that
2:33:06
it's a three-dimensional object with the Cornet like that and you can whether you're down the street um by the grocery
2:33:11
store you know walking that block it it's visible from almost anywhere along it when you walk I walked it before last
2:33:19
month meeting and I've I've done it again since and it's it's very prominent and I do you know I do have a
2:33:27
concern like I said beyond beyond this particular project that once the context
2:33:32
of the building gets changed so irrevocably that there may be less resistance to making even you know
2:33:38
further changes to it because it's like well H you know it had a context but it's gone now and right uh the the
2:33:44
Howland Center had an addition that was proposed that would have ruined the context of it even though it didn't you
2:33:49
know physically if you remember that application there there's a lot of
2:33:55
things about visual context to these iconic structures in the Howland Center this building uh there are a few others
2:34:02
on Main Street that really uh you know the the firehouses that contribute
2:34:08
intensely to something that people take really seriously vacon you know it's
2:34:14
emotionally U uh important to people they recognize it and and I think we
2:34:19
need to uh do our best to try to maintain that where we can you
2:34:25
know so acknowledge some you know um Clarity around the sensitivity
2:34:32
of this existing historic structure right again I think that the moves you're making are in the right direction
2:34:39
um yeah I just would con you know emplore you to can keep considering yeah
2:34:45
the the context especially this beloved building um not withstanding you know the
2:34:52
applicants need for this to be a viable um a viable addition so um yeah I
2:35:01
think just some more real sensitivity around its relationship to the existing building
2:35:08
the ultimate visual impact especially at Maine and the view of the
2:35:13
building um I'd also be curious I can I can I
2:35:19
understand that the rear piece is set back from the neighboring property and its height is pretty
2:35:25
significant and I was just I just happened to be looking at the Google
2:35:30
Maps that Len has up and that that neighboring property just to the what is that South is a looks like a very low
2:35:38
slung arts and crafts so it's yeah yeah I mean it's
2:35:43
it's a single almost single story right so it's going to be kind of
2:35:48
looming over for that quite a bit so you know give that some thought I know it's set back quite a bit what is that 20 ft
2:35:58
yeah yeah yeah I mean 20 ft from the property line then there's whatever the
2:36:04
neighbor has on their side yeah looks like they have five feet so um hopefully that's helpful
2:36:11
feedback yeah anything else you wanted to add David uh okay so then we'll continue um
2:36:19
with uh our Consultants reviews Natalie um sorry
2:36:27
um few clerical Corrections that are self-explanatory I don't think we need to review those um mechanical equipment
2:36:36
uh I this kind of we talked about this on another application just um noting
2:36:41
where that's going to be located and and screened there just not you know I'm assuming it's going to be on on roof
2:36:48
just cuz there's not a lot of site left here so just kind of showing that um snow storage I know John's going to get
2:36:54
into this a little bit I think there was a small space identified for snow storage um I don't that doesn't look
2:37:02
quite adequate so maybe we can just talk about that a little bit and removal um I think we're still waiting
2:37:10
for landscaping plan yeah oh speaking of which I'm sorry I just
2:37:16
noticed are you are you looking to um meet some percentage of greenery on the
2:37:25
yeah because yeah nothing's going to grow here as far as Landscaping yeah we
2:37:31
we were going to get some on the perimeter of the the parking yeah I just I just don't think this is a viable
2:37:36
place for anything to live sorry since you brought since you mentioned I did note that like 10% is required I think
2:37:42
because this is going to be such a tight sight like showing us those Dimensions to so we can help calculate that would
2:37:48
be helpful in terms of what we're talking about is landscaped area Okay
2:37:54
um so parking so no minimum number of off off street parking spaces are
2:38:00
required for this uh for this parcel uh because in the CMS district and that was done due to the district's proximity to
2:38:07
Municipal parking areas public transportation and pedestrian oriented streetscapes um however parking maximum
2:38:14
of 17 spaces is applied to the pro proposed project um based on a calc of
2:38:19
one space for dwelling unit and three spaces for every thqu ft um of commercial
2:38:25
space so you said there's four on site I guess the the piece that I'm having we
2:38:32
have an existing functioning building um that you're saying you know I think the
2:38:37
note was that the existing telephone building provides parking for two existing commercial tenants and there's
2:38:43
been no issues but now the proposal is so there's been no issues because they've had the ability and like looking on
2:38:49
Google Maps it looks like there's four or something cars parked here there's been no issues because they have some space so I I guess a little bit more
2:38:56
explanation of that in terms of what's been their utilization um because they're now going
2:39:02
to be displaced from this cuz I think the four spaces are going to be dedicated to the residential units or
2:39:08
well uh three of them three of them will be designated so that one space right but that but then I think there's the
2:39:13
potential for you know the shared parking analysis because of the time difference the new code is just really
2:39:19
focused the new parking code is really focused on using like local information and local data rather than it standards
2:39:26
and we have a unique opportunity here because you have an existing building so I just kind of wanted to see that go a
2:39:31
little bit further yeah I think so so a clear understanding of the rationale behind what you're coming to us with in
2:39:37
terms of the number of spots okay again under the new code we do have you know
2:39:43
the ability between a minimum and a maximum yeah to work with you on what we
2:39:48
all agree that is appropriate so you coming to us with what that basis is will help us okay in understanding where
2:39:56
we land on the scale of appropriateness okay thank you and I think to that same point the new code does talk about like
2:40:02
demand reduction strategies in addition to I think bike parking but just thinking about um just a little bit of
2:40:10
thought behind when these when these units are listed are they going to be saying you get one parking space or is the parking going to be unbundled or you
2:40:16
know like I think a little bit more of how this is how this is going to be managed in real time um to
2:40:25
to address any kind of parking concerns um and then I think for the
2:40:32
elevation and design standers I feel like um you guys had I think that's been talked about by the board so I was just
2:40:38
pointing at that the code you know that there's two sections of code here right there's design standards within the CMS
2:40:43
District um but then there's also uh the criteria within the um
2:40:49
historic section of the code 1347 so just looking at both of those and talking through
2:40:57
those and that's it thank you Natalie Mr Russo
2:41:04
uh so as Natalie touched upon with the snow I also agree I don't think there's sufficient area set aside for snow in
2:41:11
the area you did set aside for snow the plans are showing shrubs in a tree there
2:41:16
so I really don't think that's going to be an effective location for snow storage um so the plans need to detail
2:41:24
out include notes uh with regards to snow removal how quickly will it happen after storm events uh so on and so forth
2:41:32
okay because you're going to have parking here for people it's got to be cleaned out right and you can't just
2:41:37
shove it out onto the street yeah um as I showed you before Raa
2:41:43
there's some plan cleanups my plans didn't include the bulk tables or notes or anything else on the hearts that I
2:41:49
got so um as far as the existing conditions
2:41:55
and demolition plan if it's going to be demolition plan it should clearly Mark what's being
2:42:00
demoed on it um as far as the utilities go I'm asking
2:42:07
the engineer to verify um that the existing 4in store lateral for the building um is sufficient enough to
2:42:14
handle all flows they're noting the plumbing from the additions it going to be hooked into the build building
2:42:19
existing plumbing system in the current building now um you know we're now talking three Apartments commercial uses
2:42:27
that line size may need to be increased um also uh roof leaders where
2:42:36
they're going to drain um with regards to the building in the back um and the
2:42:41
drive there I know you're installing some drainage improvements on the road itself you may want to install another
2:42:48
basin near that driveway so there's water sheds off you can catch that and
2:42:53
you provide yourself with another location for a roof leader connection
2:42:58
yeah and then there was just some other minor cleanup comments thank you sir
2:43:04
you're welcome okay okay helpful yep very great
2:43:09
thank you we see you next month y all right next item on the
2:43:15
agenda um who needs a Qui one minute break I do we're going to take a quick
2:43:20
break we'll be right back you knew he did he
2:43:27
asked organiz okay I think we're all back so that brings us
2:43:33
to item number four in the agenda this is the continued review of application
2:43:38
for site plan approval 14 North Cedar Street for 4unit multif family dwelling
2:43:43
submitted by servone peruchi good evening good evening happy New Year and you
2:43:50
so the I'm the engineer Angelo peruchi um the big change with the site plan
2:43:56
last time I submitted this works no so last time I submitted I had
2:44:04
uh two entrances one on Church Street exiting at on North Cedar now I changed
2:44:09
that to one entrance um with now five parking spots I guess the question I
2:44:16
want to have for the board is is five parking spots all right with you guys do you
2:44:23
want more that's like one of my questions is
2:44:28
it okay for me just to have the one entrance or do you want like how it was the previous
2:44:38
subid okay yeah no we can if you want to just kind of walk us through your application it's been a while since you
2:44:43
were before us last Yeah couple months I mean those were probably the two big changes um um I did the 88 parking spot
2:44:54
um I planted more trees I planted two uh two shade trees to the left
2:45:06
um it's more that's pretty much the big thing I think uh we'll see what natal's
2:45:12
comments with the modular building uh we got to work with that but
2:45:23
okay that it yeah that's it for okay um I got a question for you
2:45:30
yeah you sort of um sticking with the theme you've sort of seen us uh address
2:45:38
on other applications um most specifically this
2:45:43
elevation this is sort of the main entry for residents is that right that's correct y
2:45:51
um you know and so this being the main entry I'm just curious if you considered
2:45:56
some sort of element that's going to Shield folks from the elements if it's
2:46:02
yeah that's we're going to add a like more covering like a porch over top to
2:46:07
protect um I think also you know that not only serves a practical purpose but
2:46:12
just aesthetically for such a large facade and tradition you know you're you're sort of doing this in somewhat of a
2:46:18
traditional style you would normally see something make that you know element the front
2:46:24
entry more prominent okay so we would certainly like to see that I'm also
2:46:30
curious too just again along the lines of aesthetic whether you absolutely need I know this is all
2:46:37
mechanical um whether you need the rounded top on the windows up top here
2:46:43
no I could remove those those are those are not real ders right no they're real DM
2:46:51
attic say again is that roof occupied no it's mechanical space so
2:46:57
those those those Dormers those three Dormer windows are not letting light into actual people's living space no no
2:47:03
they're just they're into mechanical I'm planning on removing those Dormers one because
2:47:09
of it's more mechanical space and you're taking them out completely as yeah can I
2:47:15
add something yeah yeah of course one I'm asking be recognized for a second
2:47:20
just right um so in that case you say please may I be recognized Mr Please Mr chair
2:47:28
be recognized to make to interject a uh I got to go yeah no um you you talked
2:47:33
about adding a a porch roof element to cover the the walkway on the front and I was just going to suggest John I think
2:47:39
you mentioned that this is kind of a traditional design the houses across the street are kind of a front-facing Gable
2:47:46
Victorian I was I was flipping through some Source books today today of of uh Victorian homes and if you if you
2:47:53
considered I know this is a preab building so I don't know what's available but if you considered incorporating a sort of appropriately
2:47:59
sized Center front-facing Gable with that porch along the front you could
2:48:06
pick up more of a a Victorian design language and maybe ditch the grids for
2:48:11
the 6 over six windows and you'd go from like a giant salt box to maybe more of a a Victorian kind of uh theme that would
2:48:19
complimentary to the neighborhood the other homes around it just something to throw out to for you consider yeah yeah
2:48:26
I'm going to be particularly sort of harsh here and I know this is modular um but this is a large
2:48:33
building I'm your neighbors are going to hate it I guarantee it and so whatever
2:48:38
you can do to you know begin to really think about the context you're in I know
2:48:43
it's modular I know this isn't you know Main Street but you're in you're in a neighborhood
2:48:49
where especially the back facade it's quite visible it's just this giant wall
2:48:55
of a couple of punched windows and then as it you know engages the street and
2:49:00
starts to kind of engage the neighborhood in the context it is way out of scale it's enormous so really
2:49:08
think about how again I know it's modular I know it ain't easy when you doing
2:49:14
modular to get creative in how you integrate something this size into the
2:49:21
context you're in but please think about the context yes yeah
2:49:26
okay we don't have to ask too politely we can actually demand it we will have ARB on this right I mean at some point
2:49:33
this is we're going to do it keep it in I wish I should I should um so go for it yeah I wish I had those I wish IID
2:49:38
brought those images with me because I think with some there's some um some
2:49:44
examples of that style with um you know the brackets under the eaves and like I
2:49:51
said you know the porch roof and nothing it's not doesn't need to be super ornate and you know no Overkill required but
2:49:58
but that Central front facing Gable that's the right size that uh it'll make it it'll make it a lot less monolithic
2:50:05
looking break it up a little bit with the I think that really needs to be the key here um you know to some degree it's
2:50:11
Federal style right some great yeah which we don't have a lot of over by like falcon or by the cemetery there's a
2:50:17
couple of gorgeous homes we right but if you look at the rest of the homes in the area is this going to it's not this type
2:50:24
yeah exactly right I mean you know and it could be you know at some point in the in the past it was the long house
2:50:30
and it was just this big you know Federal thing and so fair but yeah I
2:50:35
just we need to really think about really got to think about consideration for your
2:50:42
neighbors um so yeah um so let's make sure that yeah please go ahead um uh the
2:50:50
placement on the on the lot is there a reason for it to be where it is as
2:50:57
opposed to any other orientation like is it being on North
2:51:03
Cedar Street more than like maybe it's in the middle of the lot and and you know the narrow end is facing North
2:51:11
Cedar and there's more buffering of the scale of
2:51:16
the building if you were yeah I think it would fit it
2:51:24
would fit to rotate this and put it in a different location secondary Street I think this would be fine too to Street
2:51:30
Church Street yeah I mean it's just uh Brett is a one
2:51:36
way is that Brett yeah I mean I'd also like to understand this I'm sorry Mass form in
2:51:44
context of the frontages seeders one way right along North Cedar is
2:51:51
it is it continuous is it is it again it looks like a lot of those are set back
2:51:58
quite a bit more or is that across the street that's uh across the street here's the this is this is across
2:52:06
the street from their current um yeah so the
2:52:11
neighbor you know it it's more in keeping with the scale of that where you have the narrow face on North
2:52:23
Cedar is this is the lot yeah Zoom down the street here sorry we're just taking
2:52:29
a tour of the neighborhood right now though it's right now you have your front facing North Cedar correct correct
2:52:35
yeah so you've got two fairly decent sized homes across the street from it that are you
2:52:41
know like they're like princess ANS you know there a it's a foures and Gable it's not I call them the Monopoly house
2:52:48
that are all over Beacon they're small working class houses that would have cable ends they're not super they're not
2:52:54
super small but this is part of the fabric of that older part of beac but I don't think it would be I don't think it
2:52:59
would be problematic to have that be facing those there's also an argument for orienting the face toward church is
2:53:07
it Church yeah just based on the fact that your neighbors to the east there
2:53:12
there is no structure um obviously something could be built in the future but you have more
2:53:19
sort of buffer between yourself to the East and then you're you're orienting
2:53:24
the narrow side toward Cedar where there's a little bit more of
2:53:29
a scale compatibility you know what I mean yeah I Ser also if you have this elevation
2:53:36
does your entrance need to be at that elevation at high off of the gr grad where you need a hand two 88
2:53:43
ramps up to the on the on the front on the sidewalk there's two things these guys on the site yeah that's just the
2:53:50
floor elevation that's not federal no not that it's not that it's we're so
2:53:56
there's on the site plan a couple of uh uh problems one of them is your sidewalk
2:54:02
is much narrower than it needs to be and that those two ramps are super awkward
2:54:08
right so just the way that it faces and and any change and orientation in this
2:54:15
building uh would improve that and in the way that it's
2:54:20
um more in keeping with the character of the rest of the buildings in the neighborhood like Len was saying right
2:54:26
you could also break this up into two different buildings easily the modular I
2:54:32
don't know what their rules are and in fact we don't have to approve a modular if you can't make a modular thing work
2:54:39
within this building you don't you may not be able to do a modular building
2:54:45
okay that's that is a definite possibility we don't have to make that work for you we have to make it work for
2:54:51
the community and for the neighborhood okay and I said this at the beginning of this is you should really look closely
2:54:58
because we're going to ask for custom modifications because you're in a custo a a specific location you're not in the
2:55:05
middle of nowhere you're in a context where we have rules about making things
2:55:10
uh uh fit into the community character right you're going to benefit from that and everybody else is going to commun
2:55:16
benefit from a building that fits in with that Community C the value that you have for that your building and also the
2:55:22
rest of the community benefiting from your work so I think it would
2:55:28
be um uh it'd be worth your while like I said before to have a custom uh design
2:55:36
for this that accommodated that rather than trying to shoehorn a modular system that's set up
2:55:44
for a no context situation right that then has to be customized because what
2:55:49
happens with modular um uh uh companies is every customization you make it's all
2:55:56
of a sudden your your original they're all change orders so all those change orders for the Dormer for the entrance
2:56:03
putting a porch on all these things you're going to be required these little cuts that I don't think anybody here is
2:56:09
is uh uh prepared to approve what you've done right you're going to have to do all these accommodations those are going
2:56:15
to be um uh time and you know weekend rates you know what I'm saying
2:56:21
everything's going to be a lot more expensive when you get when you start changing it from that so I would suggest
2:56:26
thinking about that if you still if they're willing to work with you right I would do what Len is saying
2:56:34
try to make this so that it conforms to the existing use of the modular system you'll have to be creative you'll have
2:56:39
to have somebody who's creative that understands the context that's looking at it to work with you with this
2:56:45
existing system I don't know how flexible they are right they might be absolutely flexible with you but there's
2:56:52
the the there's another thing about the so that's I I'll just to setup that's
2:56:58
the other thing that's awkward about this is the way the parking is set up you have a 24t driveway right and if you configure
2:57:07
this differently you can have a normal width driveway and still maintain that that amount of parking right and not
2:57:14
have U A Street spot be taken away right having these wide driveways is very uh
2:57:22
it it takes it it removes street parking which is at a premium especially in this
2:57:27
area it's right near Main Street and also it um um it has a very uh institutional
2:57:35
feel it's not residential all the driveways and the rest of the block are
2:57:40
like narrow for a single um uh uh for single families right so you can get
2:57:48
four units out of this it's easy you have a large lot it'd be easy to get four units that you'll make the same
2:57:54
amount of money right but what I think we're going to ask you to do and I think
2:57:59
we should probably I would recommend require you to do is to make it look
2:58:05
like the neighborhood and and and that is a requirement that we have and and I
2:58:11
think we'd be within our rights to uh require that of you and and and there
2:58:16
are excellent Architects out out there I um some of them aren't but there are a
2:58:21
lot of good ones and I would recommend uh talking to someone if you can't uh
2:58:27
make this uh uh make the improvements or get those improvements out of the people
2:58:33
that you're working with right uh sometimes paying that extra bit of money upfront for Quality professional advice
2:58:40
in my opinion uh has uh huge benefits as opposed to pinching pennies in the
2:58:46
beginning AB abely I couldn't find the photos I had marked at home in the book but but the shape of you know a long
2:58:53
building with a long porch in front with a with a center Gable end you know that
2:58:59
kind of fits in that style again not you know I'm not recommending something as decorative necessarily is this but the
2:59:05
the massing and the and the form of it you could pick up and I think would be
2:59:10
would be compatible with the neighborhood and it would give you I think the like I said the kind of the
2:59:16
size and but yeah it's just it's it's not it's not a big it can be done without huge mods to
2:59:23
the to the shape that you're that you're looking at yeah again you're you're you're presenting you know a very
2:59:31
significant you know Mass to the site so it it needs some work it needs some real
2:59:38
thought and consideration um I'm just curious just in terms of the ramp the ramps obviously I understand the
2:59:45
requirement for um persons with disabilities but these runs seem very long I'm not
2:59:52
exactly sure what to code Bruce but I think you need to a you need a break in each of these
3:00:00
um so you really got to think about that that's Bruce's perview but if you can if you can provide um accessible
3:00:08
access into the building in another manner rather than making it this giant
3:00:13
prominent feature and again I'm not sure this is going to work okay um just by the code um give that some
3:00:23
thought as well um anything else uh by the board David you have
3:00:30
anything to add not that hasn't already been said um so let's go ahead on on
3:00:38
um on Chestnut Street there's a little garden apartment that has to have at
3:00:44
least four it's a little brick building you know a block or two away you know you might just want
3:00:51
to take a look at it for it also has the benefit of some very mature
3:00:56
trees sh shrouding it it does are you looking at that as a precedent for aesthetic no for scale oh yeah I mean
3:01:04
it's it's you know cuz that's ugly too it's ugly
3:01:12
yes sorry but it's a multif family in a single family residence IAL district and
3:01:18
the scale is not so um out of place okay let's go to our Consultants
3:01:27
um Miss Quinn um yep so just going through I
3:01:32
think as you're thinking about the board's input about maybe reorienting the building I think just keep in mind
3:01:39
John Clark had kind of done an analysis of front front yard setbacks along this Corridor so they're ranging from 5 to 10
3:01:46
ft so your building should be ranging within 5 to 10 ft from here so if you Orient it just kind of keep that in mind
3:01:51
of that location um I miss this but someone I guess I was just still wondering about
3:01:57
the storage but I I uh John let me know that somewhere in the letter it talked about that's going to be for your own
3:02:04
it's not tenant storage it's not like the residential tenants using it's you for equipment and stuff like that
3:02:09
okay um I was just looking at that um so I hear your comment about just a
3:02:15
reminder to the board um code requires a minimum of four spaces but no more than
3:02:23
um 12 provided on site so I think right now we're falling at five so we're in between that range but I think that is
3:02:30
something for us to consider
3:02:36
um yeah I I I think there's trade-offs so your first question when you started
3:02:42
was like the design the different design of the parking right and before we had kind of angled parking and it was one in
3:02:48
and one out it was in on church out um onto Cedar with the angled parking and
3:02:53
you could fit more parking spaces I think what you've done here is you've reduced that but you've reduced the impervious surface on site too which I
3:03:00
think is commendable so I'd have to look at you know in terms
3:03:06
of the access point being um I guess maybe that'll be a question
3:03:12
for for Bruce the driveway if it can in fact be shortened Beyond 24 ft less than
3:03:20
24 ft if we're doing more than four if we're doing more than a few parking spaces there I'm not sure if the code allows that if that would be a variance
3:03:28
but I thought the last layout was was a little bit more elegant um but I I don't
3:03:35
know if it's possible anymore with what you're doing in terms of the storm water management on site um and it might be preferable to have one driveway so that
3:03:42
I would just wanted to point that out to the board that there's a little bit of pros and cons between the two the one thing that is missing on this one that I
3:03:49
think if we do stay with this layout I would want to see kind of revised is there was more Landscaping screening the
3:03:56
parking um from church previously the space was was bigger there for for kind
3:04:01
of more robust Landscaping so if it does say like this I'd like to see that come back so that folks kind of walking on
3:04:08
church or if this gets flipped to Cedar that there is more substantial Landscaping between the parking and the
3:04:14
sidewalk um uh my point number five you can
3:04:21
disregard that um Bruce corrected me I'm sorry uh yeah
3:04:27
I was corrected that I read that section of the code wrong so the the proportions are a little bit off though and it
3:04:33
sounds like you're going to look at revising that anyways that that third Story Attic space is much taller than
3:04:39
the the actual living space and so I was just thinking if you're going to you're within the height requirement but if you
3:04:45
can create more I I I think this will all come into the context of like looking at the proportions of the
3:04:51
surrounding buildings in context within the neighborhood that that 11t tall um
3:04:56
third Story Attic space was much larger than kind of what you were seeing um Elsewhere on the corridor but it sounds
3:05:03
like you're already looking at that um I think we've talked about the
3:05:09
architecture enough so I can skip over that lighting plan once you get to that point there's regulations in the code
3:05:15
about lighting on site um so just kind of note note that on your lighting plan and
3:05:22
then again just looking at the ability for more Street trees and so this will come into the revised Landscaping I
3:05:28
think you do have a large mass this building is going to be a larger Mass this is the transitional zone so it is
3:05:34
kind of created for that transition from single family to multif family so but I think what you can do in terms of using
3:05:42
using Street trees using Landscaping to to try and like contextualize the facade
3:05:48
and and diminish the the size of the building as much as possible I think it's also if you look at surrounding
3:05:53
properties um that's going to become really key I think to tie this into the neighborhood of of really paying special
3:06:00
attention to the Landscaping okay thank you
3:06:05
Mr um so you heard all the architectural comments um so I'm sure you'll be
3:06:10
providing new renderings uh but one of the concerns I had with what you provided there's notes on almost all the
3:06:17
the elevation uh sheets that talk about actual house may vary from elevation oh
3:06:22
yeah I was going to say that will never fly yeah especially if you're presenting it to the board you know they're going
3:06:28
to want to see what you're actually building um so that note shouldn't be on there whatever you're going to
3:06:34
provide it should be whatever you're going to build honestly um as far as uh storm water I
3:06:42
know you've done some storm water calculations on site you went above and beyond I just want to know what's coming
3:06:48
off that site now what would be coming off the site depending upon what ultimate layout you
3:06:54
don't really need to treat for water quality okay I was like so you don't need to do water quality you don't need
3:07:00
to go to the extents you did you could probably use the rationale method I was going to ask that um I just show get it
3:07:07
done and I just need to report really don't want it on the plans we just want a report that would be okay an actual
3:07:13
report and then we can go from there um as far as
3:07:18
so you could probably get rid of the sediment Basin um you may want to have something to an effect if you're still
3:07:23
going to do dry well but we're going to have to do soil testing which um when
3:07:28
you're ready to set that up um we're going to want to be present for that um
3:07:33
to verify everything else because um you know I can't let you go forwards with the design until we actually know the
3:07:39
soils will work and I know from others in that area soils aren't that great so
3:07:44
that may not be the appropriate method to used you got a lot of clay over here a lot of clay a lot of groundwater y um
3:07:52
but yeah tons of gray clay great modeling clay um as far as your grading you're
3:07:59
going to have to take a look at your grading plan there are some concerns I have uh with the entrance out onto the
3:08:04
road itself as well as around the building um and then we have some
3:08:10
cleanup details as far as the um construction details that are on the
3:08:16
plan itself but I think um the biggest thing as you heard from the board is the
3:08:21
architecture and the layout of that site itself anything else um just like
3:08:29
parking spots just so like my design is there a certain number you guys I think that's where you have to be
3:08:37
providing us with the information as to why you've determined yeah you've put
3:08:42
five spots there let's let's understand from you next time you come back what your rationale for that is and let's
3:08:47
discuss it okay all right and and you've heard from other people that were presenting tonight or other applicants I
3:08:55
should say that we're before you um the city's code more or less is
3:09:00
looking for you to use um local examples data yeah local data
3:09:07
local examples of other facilities in the area that are similar to like we said to the last appli I
3:09:14
think talking about how the units are going to be marketed how you're going to man man the spaces whether you feel five
3:09:19
spaces is going to be adequate to meet the needs of this all of the tenants you know are they two bedrooms one bedroom
3:09:25
kind of think about that in terms of that equation who might be living there in a vehicle
3:09:31
needs well said helpful yep thank you thank you
3:09:37
thank you you'll have a good night good night okay we have zero requests for
3:09:43
extensions and zero certificates of appropriateness so with that I will make a motion I'll
3:09:50
make the motion myself to adjourn the meeting second second by Karen all in
3:09:57
favor thank you Mr chairman thank you Mr engineer May
