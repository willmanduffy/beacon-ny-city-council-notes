3:05
welcome George thank you pleasure to be back all right so we will move on with
3:12
our second item on the workshop agenda which is proposed local laws concerning
3:20
property tax exemptions for senior citizens and disabled people with limited income Chris I'll let you thank
3:28
you um so we have been talking to Kathy Martin our assessor who's here tonight
3:34
and also judge seber who works with Keenan Bean about updating our exemptions for lowincome seniors and
3:42
persons with disabilities um our our exemption levels haven't gone up in many
3:48
years and as um inflation has um basically made income higher incomes
3:55
less have less buying power we have not made that adjustment so we're we're going to be proposing um raising these
4:03
to to standardize with some of the communities around us and we've asked Cathy to come tonight to talk to you
4:09
about the law and Jud may be coming on as well in case there but certainly
4:14
Christian can help to if other questions come up so Kathy thanks for coming tonight hi good evening everybody um
4:21
Kathy Martin the City Assessor and um I'm really excited to bring this
4:26
information to you all and um hoping it's well received um this exemption is
4:32
not a new exemption the lowincome senior it's been around since the 1960s and and the City of Beacon has
4:39
offered this exemption for many years however um like the city administrator
4:44
was saying you know um economies change Market values change and um this
4:53
exemption hasn't been adjusted in quite some time so I was hoping that maybe we
4:58
could bring our sliding scale up to be in tandem with Duchess counties um like
5:05
the city administrator said um many of the surrounding municipalities are at higher levels now
5:13
and this exemption really truly helps people to stay in their homes um senior
5:19
citizens that are 65 and over and are on a limited income it can cut their taxes
5:26
in half so it's a significant EXA extion
5:31
um and it really truly helps a lot of people the disability exemption as well
5:37
um I was uh promoting having it to be at the same level as the senior citizen
5:43
exemption they usually do run in tandem with each other in most
5:50
municipalities and um currently we do have um a a few hundred people receiving
5:59
low inome come senior exemptions there's not as many people receiving the uh disability
6:06
exemption so is this similar to enhanced star
6:12
programs it is um The Only Exception is this exemption existed long before the
6:18
star program with the lowincome senior we have to include the total income the
6:25
um enhanced star is based on the adjusted gross income so so for lowincome senior we have to include the
6:31
total amount of Social Security um any total amount of any pension and any
6:37
interest off of bank accounts rental income so it's really your total
6:43
income okay you answered another question I have do you have any sense Kathy of how many um new taxpayers who
6:50
aren't currently covered with our existing limits could be positively impacted by this well I think a lot of
6:57
people that are currently receiving it it will only help them some people are receiving it at the 50% level it they
7:04
would still be receiving 50% but people that were down further on the sliding
7:09
scale may receive more if the new income limits are passed and also a lot of
7:15
people that come in and apply that just miss it by you know just a little bit
7:21
it'll be able to get all of those people into the program so and do you have a sense of
7:27
how many of those people will newly be able to qualify for the program that I don't know because you know there's so
7:34
many people out there that if the income was over you know like about 30,000 they
7:41
wouldn't have qualified so this would Encompass I would imagine a lot more
7:48
people I wouldn't know how many though that's I would expect to
7:54
um get I don't know maybe 100 more people it's just
8:00
I won't test you on that would would that be calculated into or anticipated in the budget in terms of the shortfall
8:06
that maybe anticipated well honestly it does so this exemption Works a little bit different than the star exemption
8:13
with the star exemption it doesn't um shift to the
8:21
other taxpayers but with the senior citizen because the state is funding that but with the senior citizen
8:28
exemption um whatever less is uh money is gathered
8:34
by the the seniors that are receiving the exemption that does get spread apart the whole rest of the city but it's it's
8:42
like fractions of a and so if we pass this it would go in
8:48
place this year before our taxes were the um people are just starting to come
8:54
in for their exemptions now because we send out the um forms just after the
9:01
holidays so cuz people are waiting for their year end statements and everything this law was recently changed it used to
9:08
be the immediate year they had to bring in their year-end statements but now they can bring in
9:15
2023 so um this would go into effect as of this year this for this deadline as
9:23
and that's March 1st um the deadline for oil exemptions is March 1st of every
9:30
year and going going forward will this be um linked somehow to inflation or
9:37
anything like that or is it well I bring it to your attention just because um of inflation and um the
9:46
market and everything else but this doesn't um just automatically get
9:51
adjusted it would be the city council's um you know responsibility I
9:58
guess to look at it from time to time or really I um take it on as my
10:03
responsibility to bring it to you and just you know make sure you're aware of it but just just the fact that it's been
10:09
a long many years as as you said it right maybe this we should have an alarm set saying let's look at this in two
10:15
years something yeah no that's not a bad idea yeah to look at it every few years
10:21
I had a I had kind of a similar question so what you're saying is that this is
10:26
now aligned to the values at the county level Cor and I'm wondering if you know first of
10:32
all yes seeing that this hasn't changed since 1999 and 2001 we should certainly evaluate this much more frequently um I
10:39
wonder if we could also just kind of when the county changes it um use that
10:44
as a trigger as well for us to say do we want to match that that makes a lot of
10:49
sense should be consistent and I do like to be kind of in concert with them it's
10:55
just um yeah yeah that's a great idea and I appreciate you bringing this to our attention thank you no problem I'm
11:02
happy to is it possible to get it written similar to we've had like the
11:08
the fee schedules is it possible for this to be added in and that we look at
11:14
the county figures or do we have to have these dollar amounts listed in the code
11:22
ye it has to be in the city of Beacon code yeah the school district has their
11:27
own and then the county and then the city would have theirs um but staying in
11:33
line with the county is a good recommendation yeah um I I'd be happy to
11:39
jump in a little bit for some of the procedural aspects so this would just be the adoption of a local law so you know
11:45
subsequent increases or amendments um either to you know be in conformance
11:51
with Market changes or County revisions it would just require another local law to be adopted so here this is on the
11:58
workshop at your next voting meeting it would then be scheduled for uh public
12:03
hearings it is two separate local laws since it's two exemptions that are being
12:09
uh modified here and so that requires you know two local laws to be adopted
12:14
two hearings although they're so related it probably wouldn't be a major concern to kind of hold a public hearing on both
12:20
of them concurrently okay yes and uh just one other change was the um currently the
12:30
city only goes down to 20% and I'm proposing that we go down to
12:35
5% as well because you know 10% is better than no perc
12:42
yeah especially when it comes to saving money so and it it does um help a lot of
12:48
people so just to note of maybe not everybody would agree but I really like
12:54
the the idea that this is being spread throughout the entire Community you know yeah it's good to know that we're
13:01
allting to the carnival in it together right absolutely how people
13:07
apply they can um either download an application off of the New York State
13:14
Tax and Finance website um it's the form number is RP
13:22
467b sad that I know that off the top of my head but um and they download that
13:29
form and just bring a copy of that with their driver's license to prove um their
13:35
age they have to be 65 and a copy of their 2023 income tax to my office
13:41
before March 1st but if they don't file income tax still which is the case for many seniors um you can either bring me
13:49
all your year-end statements and we'll make copies and help you fill that out
13:55
and then if you do qualify there's a renewal process so it once you get into
14:01
the program we send out the renewal forms every year just um around the
14:06
first of the year and then they're due by March 1st so if we don't see somebody
14:12
we call them cuz it's really a big savings and you know things
14:18
happen um and we want to make sure everybody gets it so and if people don't
14:23
know about this but say they're contacting your office and they say something like oh I'm on a limited income do you guys proactively offer
14:30
them some information about the absolutely and not only do we do that if somebody comes in and applies for Star
14:37
which is more often the case because for some like star is well known people have heard a lot about it so they may come in
14:44
and apply for Star but if we see that they qualify for the low-income senior
14:49
we help them apply right then and there that's great thank you very much so can they get enhanced star and this discount
14:57
yes they can so at that point their um city
15:02
and possibly um school and County taxes could be cut in half but then they save
15:10
a little bit more off of the school so it's even more than 50% with the for the
15:15
school tax because the star is just for the school right tax oh okay so the star
15:20
the enhanced star is just school just for school and this will be just property this is no this is off of
15:26
school the school district does offer this so I administer it for school County and City okay so just they're not
15:34
at the same level everybody's at different levels most do they have to fill out to a different just one form
15:42
yeah just one form okay for disabled persons with limited incomes is there an
15:47
age restriction for that there is not um what we've done and and how I've been
15:54
instructed um by the assessment Community if there if you're under 65
15:59
and qualify for the disability exemption to administer that until they turn 65
16:05
and then get them into the senior citizen program okay so they couldn't qualify for both of those they couldn't
16:12
get both no it's that one is one or the other that'd be really good yeah just do
16:17
it there we go eventually have to start giving you money um do you know anything about why the new kind of maximum number
16:25
to get the full 50% was raised to 41,600 particular do you know where that number
16:30
comes from that income number not really no I don't I know they had raised it
16:36
last year to I think it was like 35,000 and then this year they were going to
16:41
this number so we're we're always trying to hit a moving Target right yeah are
16:48
they following like possibly the Social Security Cola living yeah that I really don't
16:54
know cuz that's I could imagine some people not being able to get it because the cola was going up for a little while
17:01
right and that did happen to some people sadly yeah all right I'm just looking
17:08
does anybody else have any yeah it seems a great program it's not a question necessarily for you but it's more of a logistical question that uh maybe
17:15
someone up here can answer but I really appreciate that the U the idea of checking in on it periodically we said
17:21
like an alarm clock as George said what do we have in terms of that logistical process of knowing that it should be on
17:28
the count at a certain point in time this and other laws or programs that we want to
17:34
check in on what's our Chris is this something you know about um well it really is determined by
17:41
the department so Kathy and I can simply figure out a system for calendaring a re
17:47
a renewal and is there like a way for like the council to review like the list of programs laws that we want to revisit
17:54
at certain dates like where those alarm clocks are going off
18:00
well what other well I'm just saying that we've talked about it with other laws we should revisit this you know we talked about the parking law it seems
18:06
like it comes up periodically I'm just wondering is there like a master list that we know like you know seven months from now we should be there's no master
18:13
list but I'm glad to try to calendar this so it's done more regularly yeah I think maybe this and others would be
18:19
great yeah maybe before I um before the end of the year when I go to get it
18:25
ready to send out the renewals maybe we sit down and and look at the other rates
18:30
yeah okay yeah I'm interested for the council to know what's up coming what are we
18:35
revisiting ahead of times we have time to prepare ask around about it and even the public to know about what's going to be Revisited as as much at notice as we
18:42
can give them would be very helpful so I just want to so this is for
18:48
the tax bills going out now no that's
18:54
you would have had to apply for that last year okay so the first bill that if a person came in and applied tomorrow
19:01
the first bill they would see a savings on would be the school next school tax bill and then the property tax bill
19:06
after that okay yeah I just wanted to clear that up so then you when we do get
19:14
like everybody gets their bills you've accounted for everybody that's applied yes and those numbers well it's like a
19:20
year behind a little bit and that way it doesn't attack it doesn't affect the taxes now paid like if we had to
19:27
reshuffle it right now now after we've already set the levy and allocated the pieces of the pie to the different
19:34
properties it would be um you know chaotic yeah yeah is it possible to get
19:40
a report back at some point when we know what kind of impact this has had in terms of dollar
19:45
amounts I'm sure yeah we could do some kind of um analysis of like how many
19:52
people got previously and how many new people yeah I'm sure we could do that
19:59
all right great um and as followup I would be curious um to know the answer
20:05
to Molly's question of if if we can find out from the county where that $41,600
20:11
number came from okay yeah I can certainly ask them where that and I
20:16
think you might be right about that cuz that sounds I mean that sounds reasonable so yeah CU if it you know if
20:22
it came from something like area median income um I'm aware that you know the cost of living in is high the C of
20:29
living in the county um so I'm not necessarily proposing we come up with anly complicated system for this and you
20:36
know matching the county I think is really great progress and as Amber said thank you for bringing this to us um but
20:42
it would be helpful to to know yeah yeah okay all right I think we're good yep
20:50
okay great okay thank thanks so much c y
20:58
all right sorry all right next on the agenda for a
21:07
few items um oh actually no just the two I'm getting ahead of myself um we will
21:15
have uh our police chief uh come up and we're going to be discussing the
21:20
appointment of Derek Sherman to the position of police officer and then I'm assuming we'll kind
21:26
of have it with the appointment of Ryan cross for the position of police officer
21:33
sound also good evening Council nice to see you again George thank you um I
21:39
didn't dress this way because the fire chief upstaged me during budget presentations I literally came right
21:44
from awake so it was it was uh it was very well attended so I had to come
21:49
right here sorry I didn't hear that so
21:55
um we're going a little bit outside of our usual process here uh as as you guys might have seen in my letter um usually
22:03
we don't bring anybody to the council until they are fully completely done with every element of the hiring process
22:09
that is the case for for Derek Sherman we started with him a little earlier um we do have a few more items we're
22:15
working on with Ryan cross but we have a police academy coming up in Rockland County on the 3 of next month um and if
22:22
we don't get candidates into that one we'll be waiting months um and we could either lose these candidates on the line
22:28
online or we could possibly have to hire them like we've done in the past and kind of have them lingering for a long
22:34
period of time um so we have just a couple more steps to go with Mr Cross we're pretty confident um I don't want
22:41
to say very confident just because I tend not to get lucky when I get confident in a candidate um it's it's
22:47
unfortunate but there's can always be a surprise but I think we're in good shape with him um so what we are proposing is
22:54
getting the process started since there has to be two Council meetings um he will be through the process by the time
23:00
we get to the voting meeting so we won't have you vote on somebody who hasn't been completely completely done um to
23:07
introduce the candidates the first candidate obviously is uh Derek Sherman he's a little further along in the
23:13
process he's uh from Malboro New York he's 21 years old and he currently works as a police dispatcher in the village of
23:19
Monro where he's well regarded um his bosses and his co-workers like him
23:25
um prior to working there he earned a associates degree from Sunni olster in
23:31
criminal justice and he worked in retail as well as as an animal care attendant
23:37
at Timber Ridge Kennels in Campbell Hall do we want to go like through him or go
23:43
on to the next one I'm not sure there's a procedural issue I we just shout out to Timber Ridge where my parents dogs go
23:50
so both candidates will
23:57
okay and so the second candidate that we're proposing and as I mentioned we just have a couple more items in his
24:02
background check to complete um along with his medical uh is Ryan cross Mr
24:07
Cross is 31 years old he grew up in suffer New York down in Rockland he currently works as a project manager for
24:12
a roofing company and also holds an associates degree in criminal justice and his being from Rockland Community
24:18
College um he actually earned a running scholarship to college so uh hopefully
24:24
he's kept that up look forward to having a another fast guy on the team
24:29
um and he was inspired to get into law enforcement by relatives who were local police officers down in Rockland
24:34
County okay so what would um just to kind of clarify some of the steps in
24:40
front of us um absolutely appreciate wanting to get these folks into the
24:45
upcoming Academy that's definitely a critical date um what would we be voting
24:52
I guess next week on the 22nd okay and at that point you feel like I'm sorry on
24:57
the 21st Tuesday the 21st yes and at that point both candidates would have completed all of the um our internal
25:05
validations yes so actually the last steps in Mr cross's process are tomorrow
25:11
okay so we should know soon got it he had a couple more items uh to do on his
25:16
polygraph and then the county requires a medical exam okay yeah I was just trying to understand if we needed to do some
25:23
kind of like conditional approval or um this isn't we we could if if we if we
25:29
get to the point next week where we don't have something completed we can make that contingent upon finalization
25:35
okay we just didn't have another voting meeting before the academy starts and if we lose this window yeah no I totally
25:42
understand I just wanted to understand what we have to do from our side yeah and I you know if any of these guys come
25:48
up short we we don't want proceed you know I I think we've shown that we don't compromise any of the elements of the
25:54
background check um I also appreciate the flip side of that being flexible
25:59
with being named publicly and knowing that they might not end up passing all the things that they want so I
26:04
appreciate their involvement in this process and it meeting our needs in the city as well it shows their commitment to our needs as well I appreciate that
26:11
yeah and and I know that the chief and Lieutenant con field have gone through a lot of candidates that have not passed
26:19
one or more parts of our process so for these two there were probably I don't
26:26
know eight that didn't make it through at least yeah least yeah I don't really have any concerns with putting this on
26:32
the next meeting and then you know depending if things get bogged down this week having some kind of conditional for
26:38
Mr Cross if if required um I understand the urgency to get into the academy and
26:45
appreciate the you know trying to work through
26:50
this and while we have these folks going to Academy we're we're still eight eight
26:55
positions down that are vacant we have another person leaving in a month to two
27:01
months March March yes okay um and we are aggressively promoting our um sign
27:09
on bonus and referral bonus so uh we we have had some transfers call in um we're
27:15
going through that process we hope to bring you some transfers um in the next months okay how are you promoting those
27:22
Chris uh the chief and uh the HR Director are putting together something on indeed is it no we're going to put it
27:30
out on social media um you know police don't necessarily shop for jobs on indeed and then getting it out to
27:37
getting it out to other agencies is the most important thing and there there's
27:42
the best ways to do that are through social media and what we're hoping for the most is through the word of mouth
27:48
through our own officers who could potentially get that recruiting bonus reaching out to people because that's
27:54
actually been that's been the most successful way most jobs get transed transfers is is through the word of
28:01
mouth so frequent reminders in meetings to do that is that the aggressive campaign to get the word out yeah I
28:07
bring it up frequently in front of them like I said and we are working on Advertising uh we should have that
28:12
rolling out probably in the next week um Chris can uh sorry not Chris um
28:21
oh my gosh I'm blanking on the name of our lawyer um Nick no Christian thank
28:27
you could CHR you've been good you were close like Chris isn't right Christian
28:33
thank you sorry um uh you can tell me if this is an inappropriate uh question but
28:40
I I was um I don't know if I surprise is the right word at um the age of one of our
28:47
candidates um and I was curious how uh I guess common it might be um to be hiring
28:55
an officer so young um not that he may
29:00
not be fully qualified I'm sure he is he is the one who has gone through all of our background checks and um uh you know
29:08
due process um but I'm curious if we H how common it is to have I guess
29:13
officers on the force so that age I can't necessarily speak for how common it is but I can say that when it comes
29:20
to police officers um there is an age range for hiring um you know they have
29:25
to be within a specific age range I believe that's set by the state um so as long as a candidate you know Falls
29:31
within that age range upon applying for the academy and then as Chief has explained you passes all of these
29:38
subsequent tests they are they are eligible so ages ages not really a factor as long as
29:45
they qualify through in that age range and we have one in the academy
29:51
right now who's also last candidate is the same age okay I that was another question I wasn't sure if I was allowed
29:57
to ask sort of is This unusual for our our Force um like not it's it's on the
30:02
young side um lately as the candidate pool has shrunk younger candidates are
30:08
getting further from the process I myself started at 23 uh so it wasn't that terribly
30:14
different yeah and and I recall that we hired two um officers on the younger
30:20
side back in 2022 um yep BR and Underwood
30:26
mhm uh I guess I won't comment on that but um I
30:31
I just to note that I know that we have been hiring younger
30:37
officers um a couple other recruitment questions I noticed that these two candidates come from um they they were
30:43
part of Criminal Justice programs not in our County in different counties but I'm curious if there's what what you think
30:50
of the idea of getting the word out specifically within those who are kind of interested in criminal justice careers broadly is that something you've
30:56
ever tried or ever think it could be effective um you know we probably should
31:02
join up you know see if we can join up with DCC or or something along those lines um a lot of times people in the
31:09
criminal justice programs kind of are aware of what they already know this stuff
31:15
yeah and then when is the next civil service test is that known it's not
31:20
known yet we're actually waiting on the results to come out from the last one so okay so we're still waiting on we've
31:25
actually started uh working with the sheriff office to do um physical fitness test prep because there the next step in
31:32
the process right you take the test if you pass you get depending on the size of the list sometimes it's a higher
31:38
number uh you know you have to have a higher score to get invited to the PT test the size of this list we're probably inviting everybody um and we're
31:45
working with the county to uh to put on those um prep test uh courses so we
31:51
actually had roughly when you expect the results from the most recent tests to be know is it this they should have been
31:57
out happened almost 6 months ago and yes
32:03
okay you're waiting on the state right yeah um and then can you remind us roughly how long will it take before
32:09
assuming that Mr Sherman and Mr Cross get approved and that they start the academy on the Third Kind of roughly how
32:15
long it'll be before they're actually out as police officers at least in their training periods kind of on the streets
32:20
of Beacon usually about four months about four months yeah thank
32:26
you and then we do the three months of field training before they're actually on their own
32:32
okay any other comments and we have one graduation
32:38
coming up in early Fe Yes actually their Academy would start on the 3 and then Duchess County where Isabella is
32:44
graduates on the six great great that feels like it went
32:51
quickly but I'm sure she doesn't think so she definitely does not nobody does
32:57
yeah all right well thank you all right thanks appreciate it thank you guys you
33:04
thanks all right next we have some different appointments
33:11
um we have appointment of Sergey crov I
33:16
apologize s Sergey if I said that wrong to the conservation advisory
33:21
committee um we have his application and resume as part of the agenda
33:28
I have a general um I guess process question on these because they're all for the cic and I believe they're all
33:35
existing members they are um do we need to discuss everyone individually or can
33:40
we just kind of take this as a a group and um if there's any you know
33:46
objections or or questions on the group of them can we do it that way I we're fine with that I mean we we put this
33:53
forward as a group what if you have questions about any of the candidates Ben can help answer we asked our climate
33:59
smart coordinator Fe Leone who works with them um if she had any reservations
34:04
about all of them about any of them um there there are no concerns uh Sergey
34:10
has been the chair for quite some time of the CAC Eleanor used to be our
34:16
climate smart coordinator Phil status heads the compost program and has been
34:22
very effective at that I don't know as much about Justine but I know James Burton has been more working with us on
34:28
the um landfill grant that we got for methane so um you know the mayor had no
34:34
issue in reappointing all of them so there's no new people here yeah I
34:40
certainly don't either I just was curious like from a procedural if we have to go through every single one
34:46
individually and if people want to do that I'm absolutely fine too I just we'll have a separate resolution for
34:51
each next week but you can certainly bundle them again um purposes of tonight it's it's up to you okay I'm fine with
34:58
your approach Amber of talking about them collectively I'm similar to Chris I don't necessarily know all of them
35:03
personally but they've all served really um I've appreciated the work of the CAC
35:08
Chris can you confirm what the length of the term is is it two years the
35:14
CAC it it is two years two years great and do we currently do we know if we currently have any vacancies on the CAC
35:21
that was one of my questions I am aware of one vacancy I believe Ben yes we do
35:27
have one vacancy right now um and I know that the mayor is meeting with uh Sergey
35:33
assuming that he is reappointed to the position of chair uh later this month to discuss that among other things okay and
35:39
I do know at least one person who has recently submitted an application for that vacancy it was shortly before the
35:45
holidays um yeah we have we have that pended okay
35:50
great and Ben can you remind me is the CAC one of the Committees that
35:56
internally um alit's chair or is the chair appointed by the
36:01
mayor I can check that very quickly one
36:07
moment I think Sergey has been doing a great job just a the um it's the mayor
36:13
the mayor designates a member of the committee as chair and the the mayor is
36:18
fine with Sergey continuing and the mayor and I have a meeting with Sergey coming up in two weeks to talk about
36:25
priorities for the year um I think s for what it's worth I think he would tell
36:30
you this himself um Serge did at the cic meeting this month ask if anybody was interested in serving as chair so
36:38
um I I'm very grateful that Serge is willing to continue on in his role as
36:48
chair any other comments uh for agenda items through nine just that Ben is
36:55
working on the other vacancies so that will be a subsequent Workshop we just didn't have time to get it done for this
37:02
meeting okay thank you Ben okay all right we'll go on to agenda item number
37:09
10 the 2025 Community Development block grant program and that's you Chris yes
37:18
um so I I'll give a little background which may be repetitive to for some of you but um in case somebody's tuning in
37:26
cdbg um is Community Development block grant it's a federal program
37:31
administered by Hud and they pass um monies for housing
37:38
infrastructure um public facilities through this program each year the the
37:44
city gets an allocation through this because we're part of the Consortium with Duchess County um the only the only
37:51
municipality in the county that gets its own allocation is the city of pipy because it has the a high enough
37:58
population and um its demographics make it eligible we go in with the rest of
38:05
the county and we get an allocation that's somewhere around 190 to 200,000 each year um last year you may remember
38:12
this program got held up because of the federal budget um it wasn't released till very late and essentially there was
38:20
no 20124 round except for the city of Beacon um we we had told them that we
38:26
could quickly um turn and get that project done which we did we're getting
38:32
our reimbursements in by the end of the week which is when they're due um so
38:37
this is for the next round and it's coming very quickly our letter of interest has to be in shortly the the
38:44
deadline is then in March um we're struggling just to get something in at this point but one of the things is
38:50
doing this public hearing um we are looking to do some area on Walcott
38:56
Avenue between roughly South Street and maybe Dinan um I I don't know how far we
39:03
can go with the monies available or our city engineer right now is scoping that out so that we can um see how far that
39:10
goes um we I don't have that information yet but we want to hold the public
39:16
hearing and um get that done so that we can get our letter of of interest in
39:21
we're not even allowed to apply if we haven't done the public hearing and what we're thinking is we've done that
39:27
neighborhood which is between South davies's Terrace and the beacon Housing Authority in 2022 we did the park side
39:34
of South Avenue and did from South to West Center Street the following year we
39:40
did from Walcott all the way up to South davies's Terrace Drive or Road um and
39:46
then this year we did West Center Street from South to the recreation center so we've really been taking one of the
39:53
neighborhoods with the worst sidewalk system and just turning it over that that's what this program is
40:00
supposed to do it's supposed to principally benefit low and median income residents um so and public
40:07
facilities like sidewalks are eligible um what we thought is we're going to see if we can get the sidewalks from South
40:14
all the way to teller done um there's a couple good sections that we may be able to jump over but that way we'd also then
40:21
connect to the sidewalk project at teller Avenue that will'll be completing um this summer so again the timeline is
40:29
really tight the applications are due May March 3rd we have to have our letter
40:34
of intent in with with at least a tenative project and a tenative budget
40:39
by um uh the first week of February and we're it it's going to be clo close
40:45
because we're also working on another Grant as well with our city engineer um so this is next week we would set the
40:52
public hearing which would be held two weeks later um and I would just say um
40:59
this isn't really set up to GA gather input this is a treadmill and if people
41:06
want to propose ideas we need to actually start in a few months thinking about next year's project so it's not
41:14
without um some benefit if if other people have other ideas for these funds
41:19
we can cue that up next year but it's really been a treadmill and um the fact that we got an allocation in 2024 we
41:26
just kind of um we were the only ones that were awarded so um it's a lot to
41:33
turn around and do another project right away um but these wouldn't be awarded
41:39
they're also changing two other things they're changing the year for this so
41:44
these wouldn't be implemented um their year will start in August whereas it started earlier so it will hopefully
41:50
start to make more sense in terms of timing the other thing is this is all subject to passage of the federal budget
41:57
and I have I have no idea that whether and when that may pass and whether These
42:04
funds will be included in those um this has been something that has previously been identified for cuts um you know so
42:13
at least we'll queue it up and we'll see if we get any funding in the future is any
42:20
of what wasn't done on Fishkill a especially I'm thinking your Mill Street
42:26
with um like the crosswalk with the lighted crosswalk would that be something that
42:32
we could look at maybe next year um or or in the future would yeah I mean we've already
42:40
extended the Fishkill teller Avenue project to go to Mill Street um and that
42:45
side the crosswalk is a small item so it probably is is is less than we would want to
42:53
allocate for this would it be a lighted crosswalk um I think we can do that
42:59
other ways I I don't you know that's a few thousand we're talking about projects that are in the 200 to 250
43:06
range well I know we were talk so the sidewalk for fish galav that's planning on be happening you were
43:15
not yeah we that will be done by July of next year of this year I'm thinking next
43:22
year um I appreciate you sharing the full application in the packet Chris I think it's great to be able to see that
43:28
and similar for future it sounds like the sidewalk thing I appreciate that that is you know sidewalks that are used
43:33
and it kind of meets the criteria of what they're looking for and I I was thinking too about future things that we
43:38
don't necessarily have a plan for yet but it mentions Republic facilities community centers bike friendly features
43:44
and bus shelters so I'm hoping in the future there might be potential as we kind of think about what other things we
43:51
might want in our community to expand for that not focusing on what we might want for this year given the speed which
43:56
we have to get things in so again I appreciate you kind of helping us to to partner with you and the community to
44:03
think more long term about other things in addition to all the great sidewalk work that you've been steerhead
44:09
spearheading Thanks at what point does the project have to be kind of does
44:15
there have to be plans for this or is this kind of just an idea and they'll
44:21
allow you to you know if you get the the grant that's a good question no for for
44:27
the letter of intent it's more what do you think you're doing and what are the what's the project area and
44:34
what's the tenative budget by the application period we have to have a design we have to have photos of the
44:41
existing facility and and which like we did with West Center Street we had to show them all of the degrading sidewalks
44:48
um we have to have a detailed engineering um estimate and
44:55
um yeah so we we you don't have a lot of time to turn that around and I we also
45:00
have John just while we're on the topic of bike and and and sidewalk um you did
45:08
that resolution last week for the tip application and that tip application is
45:13
due on the 24th so our city engineer is also working up an Engineers estimate we got a conceptual plan today um basically
45:21
going with like what's the highest this would cost if we include everything and you can always dial back from that if
45:27
you get awarded it's harder to then add things later in the future and go up as as we've learned so with all of these
45:36
applications there's obviously a lot of um investment in engineering and planning and so on and administrative
45:43
stuff does that does that come out of the the award if we get it or is that it it doesn't we
45:51
don't you you you can do that but it's honorous to um try to recover those costs so we put what we do is we put on
46:00
the cdbg there might be some administrative on the tip there is not
46:05
um so again it's pretty small compared to what the return is um and and we'll
46:12
need the money I mean the beakman project right now is looking like it could be in the $3 million range you
46:19
know and if you think for a few thousand of your engineer to leverage
46:24
that so all right any other
46:30
comments um no oh one question for you Chris I know
46:36
that you talked about this before previous years that not all of Beacon qualifies can you say a bit more about
46:42
that there's a there's a cdbg catchment map on The Duchess County cdbg page and
46:49
so one of the reasons we're targeting these specific areas is because they're within the map um so Pam Fishkill Avenue
46:57
is on in that area as well um but you go across the creek and that area isn't in
47:02
it m so right um but all around uh the beacon Housing Authority the reason we
47:08
were going to stop at dining street is because that starts a new census track or block that
47:15
doesn't that isn't eligible here so we'll go we'll go right up to the border
47:21
of that if we can if we can do that thank you yeah
47:28
is there any for this project here would there be any crosswalks that would be involved in that I'm not certain yet so
47:36
I know I think I I know I have a one of the complexities is we have telephone
47:41
poles that are smack in the middle of the sidewalk so we have to figure out how to get around them we've done that
47:46
by going behind them and getting little pieces of right away from um Property Owners yeah Blackburn was done nicely
47:53
around the around the uh telephone poles yeah but you're you're supposed to have
47:58
a 4ot clear width um for small sections you can get to 4
48:05
feet for the rest you're supposed to be at 5T wide on on ada8 compliant sidewalks the reason I asked especially
48:13
on if it's wall cot with a crosswalk I know I was speaking with someone
48:18
recently that they say even just to cross Walcott even at a
48:23
crosswalk is is just very difficult and they they were asking you know why can't
48:30
we have the the lighted crosswalks so I'm wondering if that could be considered especially on the roadways
48:37
similar to Walcott and fishal Avenue that overall typically the speed is
48:43
higher in those two locations than most of the city I would say we can look at
48:49
it when we're doing the work okay yeah like when we did the stuff by teller we
48:54
extended the curb ramp we still have to go back and paint the lines on the road we ran out a time and it's been a little
49:02
the the weather hasn't been cooperative for painting lines um so we we'll look
49:08
at that area as we do that we we did improve like the crosswalks on West Center when we did that as well okay
49:16
so thank you and um unless there's any
49:22
other comments the last item on the agenda water meter upgrade project
49:28
update Chris and Christian will both be yeah so um Molly I think you had asked
49:34
for an update and it's a time it it's timely because we're going to be going out with the second set of letters in a
49:39
couple weeks but um for those that don't know what the water meter project is who
49:45
are tuning in um we are changing out all of the radio transmitters on on the um
49:52
the meters that read how much water that you use at your house uh these are called mxu units currently we are um 65%
50:01
done with the project which began early last year the first letters had gone out in June and then there were subsequent
50:07
waves um they took a little bit of a Hiatus in in the last month but will'll
50:13
be resuming uh towards the end of the month or or February and we hope that this project will be completed fully by
50:20
July or August at that time once we're up and running we'll have the ability
50:26
for everyone to log in and view their water usage history their realtime water
50:32
usage to to set alarms in case there's a leak that um might have either
50:38
Continuous Flow that really isn't normal or spikes in flow um we are going to we
50:45
we've had good compliance when we sent out the first letter but there are a lot of people that may have thrown the
50:51
letter out or just thought well I don't have to do this so we're going to be sending out a second notice um that
50:57
second notice is going to be saying you need to call and schedule an appointment which is relatively easy and fast um to
51:06
have your MX unit changed if you don't do that by April you get a $250 Sur
51:13
charge on your bill um and that that is intended to um get people's attention we
51:20
we literally had people that hadn't changed out their meters in over a decade and had never responded to the
51:27
city so absent some type of mechanism to get their attention and find them um and
51:33
and those people now as the meters are being changed out and we're getting actual reads some of them are facing
51:39
very large bills because we've estimated their usage and they significantly
51:44
exceeded that usage um and they have to pay for the water that they use so it's in everyone's interest both the city and
51:51
the homeowners um to have these upgraded to have these read in a timely Manner
51:56
and to be able to keep an eye on them I I can't tell you how frustrating it is when someone comes in with a bill that's
52:04
in the thousands of dollars after a three-month cycle when they didn't know there was a leak and with the new system
52:12
they will be able to more easily detect leaks and then remedy those before they run up um you know large bills so so
52:20
we're we're doing well in the project I think our water Department's done great we've had a little bit of bump in the
52:26
road with how the the billing Works um we're we've been you we have the vendor
52:35
for the meters and then we have a different vendor for the billing system and getting those two to talk to each
52:41
other has been some challenge so our staff has had to do uh this last water
52:47
meter run they had to do about 300 bills manually um but that's a one-time thing
52:53
and then we're through it okay um so I I just want to thank team that's working on this Sue Tucker Christine um and Ed
53:00
biki and Liz they've done a great job yeah and I think I remember
53:07
um when I when I got the letter you could also schedule your appointment online is that still an option just for
53:14
people who hate making phone calls I know I I scheduled it online let me
53:19
check okay I'm looking at the letter I I believe that to be the case but let me I did mine via phone and they were very
53:25
nice on the phone if you must call I'm sure they
53:32
were is there a cost Chris for the um when this new meter is installed because it says in the city code that the owner
53:39
is responsible for the cost of the meter is there an additional charge for these new meters no they they're not we're not
53:45
changing out the meters we're changing out the radio trans uh transmitter on the outside of your house
53:52
mhm but they do come inside to check things yeah some of them are inside mine was inside is it ins I'm still checking
53:59
they're doing a report on the on the type of line that's in there too so there's value whether it's lead he they
54:04
had to get in yeah hold on well I'm close I'll also
54:10
say that um if you haven't received a letter but you really want your meter upgrade uh you can call them and
54:18
sometimes they'll schedule you ahead of time yes so you can visit the website which is um Veo V poo metering dcom and
54:28
click schedule an appointment or you call their um number which is
54:34
877 860 8376 and again we don't have to schedule
54:40
these within 30 days but we need people to at least call call and get it on the
54:45
schedule we we Have No Illusion that we're going to be able to change all these meeting meters in 30 days right so
54:52
to follow up that and what palus said for a while it was like wait until you get your letter don't preemptively call
54:57
the schedule cuz they were going and now anyone in Beacon who hasn't had this or
55:03
has any doubts about whether they had this now is the time to call and to confirm and I I expect um probably next
55:10
week or the following week the second notice will be going out in English and Spanish
55:16
great great all right anybody other comments
55:23
um at all on this top topic no but I I do have something I want to brush before
55:29
we close the meeting okay are we good I think we're good okay um I wanted to ask the council
55:36
here so um any council member has the ability to refer something to workshop
55:42
and um I personally feel that it is time that we start talking about our
55:48
priorities for Fishkill Avenue when the group presented at the end of November
55:55
um I had suggested that we look at whether there are some very quick changes that we want to make in the
56:00
short term while we kind of tackle the the bigger longtail of the overall zoning and I think a couple of you
56:07
agreed to that I reiterated this at the December 16th meeting um that being said
56:13
I do know that the Fishkill Avenue concept committee is working very hard and I appreciate their work um I
56:19
understand that they have a plan to bring some um of the zoning recommendations to the council in
56:24
February but my suggestion is that we kind of start talking to each other
56:31
about what we think some of these priorities are I think we are going to be fairly closely aligned with the fish kill Avenue Concepts committee and I
56:38
think that we are at a point where we will we are running out of daylight on some of these things and it really
56:45
concerns me if we don't start making a plan to take action if others feel that
56:52
action is needed I certainly do so so do you mean by like a sort of an interim zoning before yeah what I had said at
56:59
the November meeting was that in and obviously I'm talking about
57:05
things that the community is talking about proposals that are in the planning board I won't make any secret about that
57:11
that is specifically what I would like I would like to understand the feelings of the council in terms of whether there
57:18
are some things that we want to take as very quick inter term steps we will certainly not be able to overhaul all of
57:24
the zoning on Fishkill Avenue in a very short amount of time but if there's a couple of things that that we are like
57:31
yeah these are really things that we need to maybe pause on so that we can get the right thing happening here um so
57:39
sort of in in lie of a moratorium or that kind of consideration yes I know that Natalie sent an email
57:47
yesterday um to the mayor and to the chair of the committee and they're trying to finalize a memo to you with
57:54
their recommendations and looks like it's kind of like what you're talking about the early outtake it's not
58:00
everything but it's the things that they feel that are time sensitive yeah yeah
58:05
and I just wonder if because this group hasn't actually really had the opportunity to talk to each other about
58:10
what we think should be done again I am not trying to usurp their process I think their process is very important
58:17
and will help us in our decision- making but I I am hearing so many questions
58:23
everywhere I go people are asking what do you guys doing and I think it is
58:28
important that we start to address that so my proposal is that we bring this into the workshop on the 27th even if
58:36
they're um not quite ready with a memo so that we can work in parallel and so
58:42
that we are ready to take action at the first available opportunity and I appreciate everybody else's thoughts on
58:49
that yeah I'm happy to use these workshops that we have as opportunities
58:54
for us to talk to to each other obviously you know taking this back to 101 because of open meeting law there is
59:02
no other space for us to as a you know group of six or seven um just I just say
59:08
six or seven just because there happen to be six of us tonight not that the mayor isn't always included um uh to
59:15
talk about um things that are not yet uh you know formulated policies that we
59:20
might you know need Chris or other experts to be um actively working on um
59:26
and so I mean I will say broadly that um in regards to some of the conversations
59:33
that I've been um hearing uh about Fishkill Avenue that I'm I'm broadly
59:39
concerned about us um building any sort of car related
59:46
infrastructure into that Corridor um that we can't take back later um I don't
59:52
think that's aligned with our climate priorities as a city MH um um and I will
59:58
say broadly that that's a a bucket of immediate concern that I have that is also my immediate concern said exactly
1:00:04
the way that I would have said it so you read my mind great didn't talk about this
1:00:10
beforehand Christian how is that handled with um with the planning board with
1:00:17
applications that are there now with in relation like if we discuss
1:00:26
something and it really is um not aligned with what is currently
1:00:35
at the planning board is it kind of too late like your
1:00:42
what you're saying I think it can be when there's already pending applications it can definitely be very
1:00:49
complicated if there's a subsequent change in zoning um you know there's a
1:00:55
possib for an applicant to claim they have a vested right in what they have
1:01:01
either just received approval for um or if you know the council does take action
1:01:07
and enacts a moratorium whether or not they would be Exempted from any zoning changes or things like that so it it is
1:01:15
something that is hard to give kind of a general statement on and it would need to be looked at kind of on a Case by
1:01:20
case basis Christian is that something we should discuss in an executive session
1:01:25
or or it just is a caseby case basis and we shouldn't there's there's no further conversation to
1:01:31
have it and again I'm going to give you another warrier answer I'm sorry it it depends as well for that um kind of on
1:01:38
the nature of you know what the applicant is doing and what the council would be wanting to discuss um as the
1:01:45
council knows there's only a certain number of reasons and go into executive session so if it falls within one of
1:01:51
those categories then the council could have an executive session so it just kind of depends on
1:01:56
on what will be discussed could we at some point um have
1:02:01
a definition or or clarify what vested uh interest in in in the project would
1:02:07
be or a developer or whatever um for what I understand it was uh what I
1:02:14
understand generally is that it's it means um breaking ground um as opposed
1:02:20
to just planning and Architectural drawings yeah and and that that is inaccurate you know a summary
1:02:27
description of that as well okay yeah I had a similar question to George and
1:02:32
appreciate that George spent more time on the planning board than I think all of us have so you might have some memories of that though it was maybe a
1:02:39
little while ago yeah and laid to that also is a part of the process too is the actual site plan approval I appreciate
1:02:45
that as before the breaking of ground and if that has not taken place if that also is an opportunity before that
1:02:51
happens um to to state we want to stay I know there have been other examples in speak in where zoning has changed after
1:02:58
something has been introduced for the planning board that as a broad statement is accurate but I don't or is my what I
1:03:06
understand but I but I don't have the detail of when exactly new zoning was introduced that then changed the nature
1:03:12
of that project I mean this is exactly why I'm asking for us to have a
1:03:17
conversation so that we can put forth a potential resolution as quickly as possible for anything that is of
1:03:24
immediate uh need to address whatever that may be
1:03:30
um and I I I don't think we can wait any longer is that is my opinion of one I'm
1:03:37
in agreement no I'm Keen for the conversation great let's do it yeah I I agree too and to George's question about
1:03:44
an interim solution I do defer to Natalie and our planning experts about whether or not it is we have to create
1:03:51
the new zoning or if we can add to our existing zoning what we might want to true or how that what is the most
1:03:58
elegant and most effective way to do that now knowing that not everything will necessarily be ready to go forward
1:04:05
yeah I kind of lean on like you know again I think these are things that we
1:04:10
have to do relatively quickly um so I think that means we look at our existing Zoning for the area and
1:04:18
perhaps there are a couple of sentences we add here and there that help to shape things while we work through the longer
1:04:24
you know what what should this area be what is our Northstar here well they looked they were working on zoning last
1:04:31
summer yeah and I think for the most part it was somewhat close but there was
1:04:37
some neighbors um concerned of residential being pulled into um as
1:04:44
commercial um and I think that was where it kind of and other steps why
1:04:50
the Fishkill Avenue Concepts committee was created to look at that as a whole
1:04:56
and I did attend uh last Wednesday's meeting of the fishal Avenue Concepts committee and you know what's hard is
1:05:04
they really haven't put had a public comment you know they've done it little
1:05:10
bits you know they did it at one of the the you know one of the festivals at the
1:05:16
riverfront park but they are looking at having on tenative date tenative
1:05:21
tenative on February 15th from 2: to 5 p.m inviting the public for their input
1:05:29
and it's so it is time is a concern because if you're looking to get the
1:05:35
community's input which we have heard from the community and then it's like too late
1:05:43
yeah and I mean I do think though that like there is there is a broader set of work that needs to happen on Fishkill
1:05:49
Avenue what is the Strategic vision for this what is the Northstar what do we want this space to be in our community
1:05:55
in the long term and that ABS again I think that their process can continue on
1:06:00
with that but I do think that we have some things that we are seeing that we would say this doesn't
1:06:07
feel like the right direction and we can probably very quickly course correct that and still let this work continue
1:06:15
this body also has the ability to have public comment if we were to make any changes I'm sure it would be subject to
1:06:20
a public hearing any zoning changes would subject
1:06:26
to a public hearing absolutely because it would have to be done via local law yeah and again I I think that there is a
1:06:33
I think there's a much a conversation that's going to take much longer for what do we want to be when we grow up
1:06:39
here on Fishkill Avenue than like how do we make sure that we have
1:06:45
the ability to do that and that we don't cut ourselves off from being able to influence because things have happened
1:06:51
while we were waiting for for the right direction yeah I think it might end up
1:06:56
some of those might end up playing out similar to The Main Street access committee that you were on pan that even when they have their proposals it will
1:07:03
take city council to actually enact those changes and that that process will take the time it takes so there might be
1:07:09
a step that we want to take now if we already see a need to do so yeah yeah my
1:07:15
concern is just that we lose the opportunity to influence this area at all and and then it's like well what was
1:07:20
the point so it sounds like we are all in agreement that we should have a discussion about about specific things
1:07:26
that we would want to do in the short term on the 27th and Are there specific
1:07:32
questions that we have for um I guess for Chris or for Natalie that we would
1:07:37
like answers to before we walk into that workshop on what some of our options might
1:07:43
be or are we not there yet so we can't ask you anything I have not been
1:07:48
involved at all on this so and I know the planner is working with the mayor and the committee I think they're very
1:07:55
close to coming back why don't we see if they can actually come in on the 27th so
1:08:00
you have a baseline of what they've done if you are working at odds with them um
1:08:07
I don't think it's going to help on the time okay they don't feel that they would be ready on January 27th they are
1:08:15
looking at February 10th that's what they had verb that
1:08:20
would they said that at their meeting is it is it possible to request from them between now in the
1:08:28
27th for them to prioritize and time sensitive issues that they see and that
1:08:33
way they really were prioritizing last time I mean really the one thing that they haven't really discussed is height
1:08:40
but they have discussed kind of what they're looking at The Pedestrian friendly and bike friendly area and they
1:08:48
did have several they kind of went through what they want and not want and I feel like
1:08:56
we kind of are all it's what we're hearing from the community too I would
1:09:02
definitely say I I'm hearing that so is that enough to move forward on an item
1:09:08
or two if there was consensus I mean I honestly like not to
1:09:14
be a jerk but I don't think that we actually have to have consensus with the committee like I am hearing from the
1:09:20
community on a regular basis about a specific concern and I would like to address
1:09:26
that yeah I think that's sort of my broad understanding about our powers and duties as people like that that's what
1:09:34
we can do set up to advise us but we can be advised from other places as well I
1:09:39
also don't think that we are actually not in lock step with them so I I don't have
1:09:46
a um I think for questions I think the thing we raised here is if we wanted to make changes that are are effective of
1:09:53
zoning like what's the best way to do that so I think even if the memo itself isn't presented like having Natalie
1:09:59
available it sounds like she'd be the best positioned to help answer some of those questions um maybe I guess our
1:10:06
member of our legal team can also potentially do that so I think we know what our um our options are there might
1:10:14
be things we want to push forward that we hope are aligned with the committee but if they're not ready we don't necessarily want to drag them even even
1:10:20
though their meetings have been public and people can be following along we don't want to force them to come before if they're not ready for that yet we we
1:10:28
can see if Natalie is available I know she was on our meeting shortly she's been tuning in um okay and I went off
1:10:34
the meeting because we were done yeah no I know I called an audible here but I'm
1:10:39
working on on the the charter provision that allows council members to refer an item to workshop and I feel very
1:10:46
strongly that we need to discuss this immediately we we'll see if Natalie can be available thank you Chris appreciate
1:10:52
that I have one other um ask is it possible you know having
1:10:59
attended the Fishkill Avenue Concepts committee meeting on Wednesday is it does the city have for committees to use
1:11:07
a microphone and speaker setup for virtual meetings when when we don't have
1:11:14
our sound system available because I know it was very awkward people are moving around the the computers on these
1:11:21
tables trying because the people virtually couldn't hear the you know where the person was sitting at Chris's
1:11:27
side um when when the committee has requested the Smartboard and the
1:11:32
speakers and the mics yeah we we have given them that I mean we had the
1:11:38
Smartboard at one of the one of the meeeting the Smartboard was out but
1:11:43
there wasn't any microphones or anything maybe they just don't know that they can
1:11:51
use everything or how to the chair can just reach out to Ben whatever ever they need they can let us know I don't know
1:11:57
why they we only need the mics really because of broadcasting online yeah
1:12:04
um yeah it would have been helpful because you know even to have a microphone on somebody's computer so
1:12:11
people could hear what the other it was just very hard to hear and this isn't
1:12:16
the first time that yeah I think maybe to say what you're saying another way Pam is that um there are committee
1:12:24
meetings like like I've mostly been to CAC meetings where some members of the
1:12:29
public and some members of the CAC are joining via Zoom so it's a classic
1:12:35
hybrid Zoom meeting situation um and it may you know if if the need is this
1:12:43
whole setup with all of the mics and the whole sound system turned on and hooked
1:12:48
up to zoom um that might be appropriate for um a large committee meeting like
1:12:54
the Fishkill Avenue Comm where they're also doing presentations but for a
1:12:59
smaller meeting like a meeting of the ca um just having a quality um
1:13:06
microphone that could pick up a conference call um would potentially
1:13:12
make a difference in terms of accessibility of those meetings I I believe if you're doing that you need
1:13:18
Pete to be here and we don't have him here for all of the Committees to have
1:13:24
of an equipment can you hold a second Ben Ben could you chime in on that please yeah I think for just miking like
1:13:33
plomo is saying for the latter case maybe it wouldn't it sounds to me that PL is just describing microphon a um on
1:13:41
the laptop so that everyone in the room could hear where the complexity lies as if things were being broadcast on zoom
1:13:47
in any form and you have like this hybrid inperson Zoom meeting like what I believe Pam is referring to at the
1:13:53
Fishkill Avenue committee um that becomes more complicated and would likely require Pete to be here and I did
1:14:00
get a text from um from Natalie who can be here on the 27th and she said she
1:14:06
thinks they can be done with the memo by that time that's amazing so thank you appreciate that thank you so much
1:14:13
Natalie um okay we maybe we can continue the zoom microphone conversation offl
1:14:18
this is this not critical City business yeah okay all right thank you for um
1:14:25
talking through that I look forward to uh further discussions on this and um
1:14:30
should be fun all right all right and um I don't think I actually said that the
1:14:37
Mayor Lee kiraku was excused from this meeting so say that at the end I'm
1:14:42
reading it up here I apologize yeah um
1:14:48
and just announcing our next meeting is next Tuesday due to the holiday on
1:14:53
January 21st at 700 p.m. and that will be a regular
1:14:58
city council meeting where the public can speak during the public comments section okay and I will give you a
1:15:04
motion to adjourn motion to adjourn second all in favor I I all right we are
