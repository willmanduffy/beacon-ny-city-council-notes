# Beacon City Council Meeting Summary

March 17, 2025

## Overview

The Beacon City Council meeting on March 17, 2025, addressed several significant topics including two public hearings: one regarding zoning amendments for East Main Street and another concerning regulations for drive-through facilities and self-storage businesses. The council also voted to refer proposed accessory apartment requirement amendments to the City of Beacon and Dutchess County Planning Boards. Public comments covered a wide range of concerns including communications planning, Route 52 corridor development, accessibility of city facilities, and the prison grounds property.

## General Public Comments [0:01:58]

### Communications Planning
- A resident presented results from a community survey indicating strong desire for improved city communications
- 53% of survey respondents felt it was "very important" to do more soon to open better two-way channels for communication with city government
- The survey suggested current city communications were ineffective across various categories
- Request for the mayor, city administrator, and council to prioritize developing and implementing an effective communications plan

### Route 52 Corridor Development
- Concerns expressed about potential negative community impacts of zoning out car repair shops from Route 52 corridor
- Argument made that local car repair services are vital for affordability, particularly for families, elderly, and local businesses
- Concern that eliminating repair shops would create hardship for residents who rely on walking to these services
- Request for council to be mindful of potential long-term effects of banning car-centric uses

### City Facilities Maintenance
- Report about deteriorated grills at Riverfront Park that are rusted out and unusable
- Request for replacement or repair of these grills to improve usability of park facilities for residents

### Prison Grounds Property
- Concern about transportation issues related to the prison grounds
- Suggestion that access to the prison grounds should be planned from Main Street
- Recommendation for a long-term plan addressing transportation issues on 9D and Route 9 before any construction occurs
- Encouragement for Beacon to take leadership on addressing these county-wide issues

### Accessory Dwelling Units
- Question about the accuracy of ADU data, with resident noting they know of more than the five reported legal ADUs
- Inquiry about how legal ADUs are designated and tracked in property records
- Concern about enforcement of owner occupancy requirements and what happens when properties with ADUs are sold
- General support for expanding housing stock through ADUs, but concerns about tracking and enforcement

### Fishkill Avenue Reimagining Process
- Frustration expressed with how the reimagining process for Fishkill Avenue has been handled
- Concern that the process was "merely a way to check a box rather than to truly engage with public concerns"
- Perception that public interest wasn't being genuinely considered despite numerous public comments and recommendations
- Call for city council to reconsider approach and demonstrate accountability

## Public Hearing for a Proposed Local Law Amending the Zoning Map Concerning East Main Street [0:19:42]

### Discussion
- Proposal to change zoning of 25 properties at 1 East Main Street from Light Industrial (LI) to Central Main Street (CMS) district
- Building inspector noted uses have changed over several years to more appropriately fit within CMS zoning
- County Planning Board provided a comment memo indicating this was a matter of local concern
- City Planning Board agreed rezoning makes sense in terms of use regulations but questioned whether CMS district was appropriate for dimensional and density regulations
- Planning Board suggested General Business district might be more appropriate for dimensional requirements

### Concerns Raised
- Lack of explanation about economic impact of zoning changes on property taxes
- Questions about how changes would relate to parking requirements
- Unclear whether property owners had been consulted or surveyed about the proposed changes
- Concern about potential litigation from owners who might oppose the changes
- Perception that changes were being made without adequate documentation of qualitative and economic impacts

### Next Steps
- Public hearing was closed
- Council will take Planning Board recommendations into consideration
- Mayor clarified that zoning changes typically don't affect property taxes unless they dramatically change assessed value
- Matter to be discussed at future workshop meeting scheduled for March 31

## Public Hearing for a Proposed Local Law Concerning Use Regulations for Drive-Through Facilities and Self-Storage Businesses [0:26:37]

### Discussion
- Proposed local law would eliminate drive-through facilities as permitted uses in all zoning districts
  - Currently drive-throughs are only prohibited in CMS and Linkage districts
- Proposed law would also eliminate self-storage businesses in all zoning districts
  - Currently permitted in General Business (GB), Light Industrial (LI), and Heavy Industrial (HI) zones
- Planning Board recommended a more specific approach rather than categorical prohibition
- Suggested identifying specific areas where these uses should be prohibited rather than a blanket approach
- County Planning Board indicated this was a matter of local concern

### Support for the Prohibition
- Argument that drive-throughs have negative impacts in urbanized areas including:
  - Conflicts with pedestrian movement by creating additional curb cuts
  - Requires large land areas for queuing lanes that could be used more efficiently
  - Disrupts urban fabric and prioritizes car-centric design over pedestrian-oriented development
  - Creates traffic management issues and increases vehicle idling/emissions
- Contention that Beacon's compact, walkable scale is a community asset that should be preserved
- Concern about negative impacts on the planned rail trail development
- Argument that drive-throughs diminish sense of distinct character and generate less tax revenue per acre
- Support from Conservation Advisory Committee citing safety hazards, conflicts with climate goals, public health impacts

### Opposition to the Prohibition
- Argument that drive-throughs provide necessary convenience for parents, elderly, and those with mobility challenges
- Concern that prohibition would reduce revenue potential for businesses and the city
- Reference to COVID-19 pandemic when drive-throughs were essential services
- Point that similar businesses with drive-throughs exist in neighboring communities
- Concern about limiting business options that could generate tax revenue
- Argument that proper design could mitigate concerns about pedestrian safety and environmental impact
- Request to consider grandfathering in the already-approved project at 420 Fishkill Avenue
- Suggestion for alternative approaches like special permits or specific design requirements rather than outright prohibition

### Next Steps
- Public hearing was closed
- Council to discuss feedback at the March 31 workshop
- Planning Board's recommendation for a more targeted approach to be considered
- Discussion of potential alternative regulations such as special permits or design guidelines

## Resolution No. 34 - Referring a Proposed Local Law to Amend the Zoning Code Concerning Accessory Apartment Requirements [1:14:30]

### Discussion
- Resolution to refer proposed accessory apartment amendments to City of Beacon Planning Board and Dutchess County Planning Board
- Scheduling of public hearing for April 21
- Key changes to accessory apartment requirements include:
  - Permitting accessory apartments in all zoning districts for existing detached single-family properties
  - Removing minimum apartment size requirements
  - Allowing building inspector to issue permits for accessory dwelling units rather than requiring planning board approval
  - Introducing architectural review (ARB) for accessory units less than 10 feet from property lines and within 20 feet of adjacent dwellings
  - Adding definitions for "occupied primary residence" and "owner"

### Concerns Raised
- Question about requirement for site plan approval when accessory unit exceeds 50% of primary dwelling size
- Discussion about what constitutes an "accessory" versus "primary" structure
- Concern that the 50% threshold might unfairly burden owners of smaller houses
- Question about whether full site plan review is necessary or if a streamlined process could be created

### Next Steps
- Resolution passed to refer amendments to Planning Boards
- Council directed staff to specifically ask Planning Board for opinions on the 50% size threshold
- Public hearing scheduled for April 21
- Planning Boards to review and provide feedback before public hearing
