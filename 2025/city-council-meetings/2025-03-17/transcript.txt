0:16
good evening everyone Let me uh call the meeting to order Let's do a pledge It's behind you The flag
0:24
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the
0:29
republic for which it stands one nation under God indivisible with liberty and
0:35
justice for all Thank you All
0:41
right Um let's do a roll call I see the city administrator I see uh George uh
0:49
Pam Paloma the mayor's here and Amber and Jeff Um Molly is uh traveling and
0:56
excused And I also see the city attorney Welcome Thank you And our city planner is online as well Okay Hey Natalie Good
1:03
evening Cool Um so first order of business uh is
1:09
a couple of public hearings
1:15
So uh that means I'm going to open up public comments first and then we'll do
1:22
the public hearings Remember for those who want to make a comment a general comment you may do so first Um if you
1:29
are here to make a comment on either of the public hearings one is concerning a
1:35
zoning map affecting East Main Street and the other is concerning uh zoning uh the drive-through facilities and self-
1:41
storage businesses If you want to speak on either of those just hang tight Uh if you want to make a general comment this
1:48
is the first uh opportunity to do so I'm going to read off the list Uh Scott Lurman come on up
1:58
have copies for the council if that's okay I'll just I did send this ahead of
2:03
time Yeah
2:09
Good evening I'm Scott Lurman and I live at 40 North Street At the last meeting the council decided
2:17
to schedule a discussion about communications planning at the upcoming workshop Uh I thank you for that Um but
2:23
in listening to you there seemed to be some concern that Beacon does not have the resources to take on evaluating
2:30
planning and implementing a more effective communications approach this year I urge you to re-evaluate the
2:37
priority you give to communicating well with the Beacon community So what's so
2:42
urgent Um I had sent this to the council which is a survey where we did a
2:50
quantitative survey that I sent to the council last week highlighted the importance that the community places on
2:56
goals like evolving zoning to better achieve community goals protecting historic assets rethinking the goals of
3:03
the comprehensive plan protecting natural resources and expanding opportunities for the community to have
3:10
an ongoing dialogue with the mayor city council and planning board In fact over
3:15
53% of the respondents felt it was very important to do far more and soon in
3:22
opening better two-way channels for communication with the city government
3:32
Just to be clear uh public comments made here where the council only listens and
3:38
council workshops where the public can only observe are are very helpful but they're not opportunities for dialogue I
3:45
I think I want and I I think we in the community want to speak freely with you
3:50
as a community in open forums This past week I also sent you the results of a
3:55
quick qualitative study that gives you a sense of the effectiveness of current city communications across a range of
4:02
categories from the most tangible like emergency and legally required communications all the way up to very
4:08
open-ended things like inspiring the community to service and action Uh that
4:15
chart where all you can see from here is um it actually says that there's an
4:22
overwhelming percentage of people that think improvement is urgently needed in
4:27
the city's ability to inform interact with and activate the community So again
4:33
I asked you mayor the city administrator the council to reconsider um and
4:40
dramatically consider raising the priority of developing and implementing an effect communications plan in the
4:47
upcoming months Thank you Thank you Uh Sergey Kasichov
5:00
Good evening Council Mayor Uh sorry Carassic word three I want to acknowledge the great work Fishkill
5:05
Avenue concept committee has done to date to help us to reinvision Route 52 corridor While you often hear me
5:12
expressing support for pedestrian and bike oriented urban planning I do want to discuss potential negative community
5:19
impacts of one of the committee recommendations that of zoning out carcentric users from the corridor or
5:25
more explicitly car repair shops A lot of this in prior council's times and effort has been spent on attempting to
5:31
address the affordability crisis in Beacon We as a community have focused a lot on housing and rightly so as this is
5:37
one of the biggest expenses and arguably the most important amenity we as humans need But there is a host of auxiliary
5:45
affordability issues that can impact communities such as local availability of needed services
5:52
One important aspect of affordability is owning and maintaining a cheaper and used car On top of regular service needs
6:00
all the cars tend to break more often So access to reliable trustworthy and ideally very local car repair shops is a
6:08
vital necessity that can have considerable financial and employment implications Let's consider a parent
6:14
with a small children To bring a car to a shop say in Wapenes they would have
6:19
several options hire a babysitter while they wait for two three hours for the car to get fixed take a cab home and
6:25
then back to the shop or rely on friends or neighbors All of which is significant
6:30
financial and societal expense Time off to manage car service or repair can also
6:35
have negative impact on employment as garages tend to have similar hours as most other regular jobs I a fairly uh
6:43
used car owner even a couple of those have built relationships with couple mechanic shops in Beacon including one
6:49
on route 52 This has been tremendous asset for me and my family to be able to leave a car to shop at any time and walk
6:55
home I also developed trust with some of the mechanics many of whom are local
7:01
residents Uh and I trust that they will only fix what's needed and charge me fairly Route 52 shops have also been
7:08
great for One Nature uh landscape design company I work for Ability to have trustworthy relationships with very
7:14
local shops has helped with managing our small fleet of vans and trucks efficiently and to have reliable and
7:21
safe work vehicles for our employees While I do want to dream of beautiful customerf facing shops all along Route
7:28
52 and the future rail trail reality is we have cars We will have cars They need
7:33
and will need to be serviced and repaired And we do not have a perfect area in Beacon where that can happen I
7:40
would strongly advise the council to be mindful of potential long-term effects of banning carcentric uses at least the
7:47
repair shops as they vital necessity Thank you Thank you
7:53
Uh I'm reading down the list but I'm only going to pick on the people who've checked general comment Dennis
8:06
Pavlock Good evening council mayor Um I'm here tonight and when I used to
8:14
let me just go back for a minute When I used to live here um some once in a
8:19
while I I use the facilities down the riverfront you know the pavilion Nice
8:25
day you want to do some grilling with some friends family and I noticed
8:30
that every I should say the majority of the grills down at at Memorial at at the
8:35
riverfront are all rusted out and burned out And if you go back at my comments I
8:41
don't know what year it was but I brought it up then and they're still like that today And I'm just asking what
8:48
are people that are going down there for using the park for want to grill out and
8:53
cook out and they can't cook out because they don't have any they're short on grills I counted about four or five of
8:59
them that are completely rusted out and they're just sitting on a ped a rusted pedestal And you know I don't know how
9:06
many uh I think the ones up uh in the in in the Memorial Park I think they're all
9:13
solid and still able to be be used but the majority up down a riverfront are
9:19
just rusted through rotted and rusted right through and they're just sitting just sitting on a pedestal just doing
9:25
nothing So if that could be done something with that'd be great Thank you
9:31
Thank you Uh Clark
9:46
Gman Clark to Main Street Per listen to me I'm losing my mind Wilson Street
9:52
Beacon New York I was thinking about Main Street
9:58
Um what's confusing about the proposal is the long-term impact on use
10:07
and taxation And it would be ideal if a
10:13
proposal came What proposal please Okay Am I my Oh I'm wearing public
10:19
comment Yeah On my bad I'm losing my mind That That's the next one Yeah Hey Um so
10:26
at any rate uh there's a lot happening uh in the neighborhood regarding um the
10:34
prison ground And um I'm reminded uh of uh 20
10:41
years ago I I did a little uh proposal for uh the regional planning group Kind
10:49
of freaked him out It was at the DIA It was a document that kind of showed uh
10:55
some of the transportation pitfalls in the neighborhood Um and and of course
11:01
I've long advocated that it should be a university but that's beside the point
11:06
Um including the entire park district that was once part of Sunni that was
11:13
hijacked by Farmingdale in competition for regional uh locations of
11:18
universities and money and things like that But that's a whole another too long of a story to tell But there is one
11:25
thing is very clear that the access to Main Street in
11:30
the middle of Main Street somewhere near the existing parking facilities on the north side
11:38
ought to be some kind of long-term planned access to the prison ground
11:44
And that prison ground should go all all the way up to Wingers is where the new
11:50
Hamburg station is to bisect that massive property that causes uh
11:57
transportation problems on 9D and 9 There need before there is any
12:03
construction on the prison ground there needs to be a longterm
12:09
plan that serves the best interest of the city of Beacon and the state of New
12:14
York as well as the residents of southern Duchess County And I know the council over the
12:22
last 20 years has been very reluctant of sticking its nose into things that are perceived not your dominion seconds but
12:30
the city municipal law is very strong and there's no reason why Beacon
12:36
shouldn't be leading the way in addressing these more uh uh southern
12:41
countywide issues It would behoove the city to take that opportunity Your time has elapsed Thank you
12:49
So anyone else in the public here want to make a general comment Not about
12:56
either the two zoning hearings uh public hearings we're going to have So a
13:01
general comment not about either um drive-through facilities
13:08
or self storage or about East Main zoning Okay Uh online anyone
13:16
P If you're on Zoom and you'd like to make a public comment please use the raise hand option at the bottom of your
13:21
screen If you're joining by phone you will need to press star 9 Lastly if you're joining us on YouTube you will
13:28
need to join the Zoom link instead by visiting beaconny.gov and going to our events calendar where you can find the
13:34
link As of now we have three hands raised for general comments First is ML
13:39
ML you have permission to speak whenever you're ready Thank you Ben Good evening council and mayor
13:46
Um my comment is about the ADU law that you're referring to the planning board
13:53
and to Duchess County and um so I know it's not finalized yet but I have some
14:00
concerns about the data and I'm aware that we have a new uh
14:06
building inspector so they might not know exactly where to get this
14:11
information but I know of several new ADUs and I have some other friends that
14:18
reach out to me that know about several others ADUs So the number of five in the
14:25
recent years just doesn't make sense I also wanted to know if when there is a
14:31
legal ADU there's the uh designation change I to like
14:39
uh single family house with one accessory dwelling unit like I see in some properties in the city and if not
14:47
then what is the indication that there is a legal edu in that
14:55
property Um what else Um also have a concern
15:00
about the enforcement of owners
15:05
um residing in the unit and what happens when the when the when the whole place
15:11
is sold like what happens if you have a renter inside There's some things to think
15:17
about Um in general I'm supportive of the idea of expanding our housing stock
15:24
through ADUs but um I know that we have like challenges with enforcements of
15:31
short-term rentals and I want to make sure that if we're creating a law that we know how it's going to be tracked and
15:38
how it's going to be enforced Thank you Thank you
15:45
Our next Zoom speaker will be Meg Meg you have permission to speak whenever you're ready
15:52
Hi uh Meg Lazarus W one resident and member of Beacon Climate Action Now and the Beacon Bicycle Coalition Um I just
16:00
joined to just quickly mention that as a resident of Beacon I personally felt a bit frustrated with how the process of
16:07
the reimagining of Fishkill Avenue has been handled And I've also spoken to a lot of folks in the city who feel
16:13
similarly It's raised a serious concern among us residents about whether this process was merely a way to check a box
16:19
rather than to truly engage with public concerns Um it's often sort of felt like
16:25
there's just always been a plan for that stretch of land and it feels kind of disappointing to get the sense that we're all sort of going through these
16:32
motions making recommendations giving public comment but ultimately how much is the public interest really being
16:37
considered I was texting with a friend last week who said I quote "I understand the motivation of having a Healey rep on
16:43
the committee Changes to that stretch of stretch of land will directly impact their properties but once you sue the
16:48
city it starts to look like your role on the committee is one of self-interest and as an antagonist to progress not
16:54
supporting what's best for the larger community." End quote So I just want to say this is what the conversations are
17:01
sounding like around Beacon So I'm asking you to reconsider your approach demonstrate some accountability here and
17:07
some take some meaningful next steps and actions uh to align better with the
17:13
interests and the needs of the community Thank you Thank you very much
17:19
Our next Zoom speaker will be Teresa Teresa have you permission to speak whenever you're ready
17:30
Good evening I fear the direction the city is moving with the desire to split every property into two lots is not the
17:37
way to go I agree with the previous speaker that not all ADUs and Airbnbs
17:43
are on record I see many new real estate sales showing multiple cars on the lots
17:50
We are not a carless city Save the rails Have a good night
17:55
Thank you Is that all we got online Ben for general comments We have one more that
18:02
was just raised Okay Uh our next Zoom speaker is Darra Darra you have permission to speak
18:11
Uh this is uh you unmuted me This is Arthur Cam speaking Um I just wanted to
18:16
make a quick comment about ADUs Um I appreciate the idea of increasing the
18:24
housing supply um as a step toward um increasing affordability But I want to
18:31
say um once again that simply adding um units to the housing stock uh in the
18:39
context of the high demand for um apartments in Beacon and the push on
18:45
housing costs that simply adding ADUs will not necessarily um increase
18:52
affordability Therefore seems to me that um the thing that would do that is to for ADUs to
19:00
either require them to be used by a family member or require them to be
19:08
affordable whether it's below market rate or section 8 or something like that
19:14
Um outside of that um I don't see it may be convenient for people who want to add
19:21
a family member I have no problem with that But there won't necessarily increase affordability Thank you Thank
19:29
you No further speakers on Zoom at this point
19:34
Okay All right So let's start up the hearings So there's two public hearings The first one uh concerns uh an
19:42
amendment to the zoning map uh on East Main Street where Maine and uh East
19:48
Maine are I'll ask for a motion and a second Uh I don't need a motion in a second to open the public hearing That's
19:54
correct Scheduled All right So I will open the public hearing by first requesting either Natalie or Nick to
19:59
tell us a little bit about this So thank you mayor and members of the council Good evening So on February 24th the
20:06
city council discussed a proposed zoning map amendment recommended by the former building inspector The building
20:11
inspector's memo is included in your agenda packet as well as the local law the zoning map the use tables and the um
20:18
comment memorandums from the county and city planning boards Um the proposed local law would amend the city zoning
20:25
map to change the zoning of 25 properties all commonly located at one east main street changing them from the
20:31
light industrial district to the uh central main street the CMS zoning district As the building inspector notes
20:37
over the course of several years the uses have undergone some changes and those changes more appropriately fit
20:43
within the CMS zoning rather than the light industrial zoning So the county
20:49
planning board provided a comment memo that it was a matter of local concern They left it to your discretion The
20:55
city's planning board met last week and issued a comment letter with today's date that is placed in your packet late
21:02
this afternoon And on their um two paragraph memorandum they note that they
21:08
reviewed it There were some comments by our attorney from our office Jennifer Grace summarizing the local law as well
21:14
as commenting on the building inspector's memorandum And then the board had some discussions about the proposed amendments And they note that
21:20
the consensus of the five planning board members in attendance was that reszoning from LI to CMS makes sense in terms of
21:26
the use regulations But the plan board questioned whether the CMS district was appropriate for the property in terms of
21:33
the dimensional and the density regulations The other side of zoning zoning looks at what uses are permitted
21:38
on the property It also looks at how those uses that are permitted are allowed to be placed within the property
21:44
in terms of the setbacks from property lines as well as how much the density Um and so they thought that with respect to
21:51
the dimensional requirements it might be appropriate to look at um perhaps reasoning to the general business
21:57
district for the reasons they've mentioned in their memo Very good Um okay thank you for that So
22:05
I'm opening the public hearing on this particular amendment which concerns one
22:11
East Main Street Um and I see on the list one person has checked wanting to
22:16
make a comment at this hearing That's Clark
22:33
Gman Clark to Wilson So as I started to say I'm a little
22:40
troubled by zoning changes that doesn't explain the economic impact to the
22:45
city's collection of property taxes And then the follow on would be
22:51
how does it relate to the parking schedules And then it also raises some
22:57
questions as to is this something that was requested by the majority of the co
23:03
c co-op or it is a co-op I I I I would imagine if condo condominium condominium
23:08
excuse m Yeah the condo So everyone has individual ownership rights They bought them under a certain thing I don't know
23:14
that there isn't going to be litigation from someone who opposes it So and so the I don't know that the city has
23:20
really offered up a questionnaire for the applicants and whether all the applicants have signed the application
23:26
or whether or not it's just something the city has observed and and and seeks
23:31
to uh clean up the the record books But it does bring forth the
23:40
whole hodgepodge nature of zoning to fit the the use as opposed to zoning that
23:49
fits the city's property tax base and livability and functionality I I
23:56
personally uh understand that people have made an extensive investment in that property and that maybe this brings
24:04
them a better yield and potential I don't see any of that in the moving records And so as a matter of
24:12
communications and clarity and comprehensive understanding of the
24:19
economic equation being presented I I think the council should get in the
24:24
habit of not having these things before it without having all that due diligence
24:31
And it may be if it's coming from the owners that they should provide for some
24:40
kind of land use or appraisal of some sort That would explain all the the
24:46
variant issues so that not only the council but the public understands why
24:52
this ying and yang at this particular location at this particular prime time is appropriate But you really don't seem
25:00
to have amassed the kinds of qualitative documentation that would fit such a move
25:09
And and I don't know whether this increases the value which would be good
25:15
or decreases it but do any of you
25:21
know Thank you Uh anyone else in the physical public want to comment on this particular
25:28
public hearing Again this is concerning resoning at 1 East Maine Okay And then uh Ben anyone online
25:36
want to comment on resoning at 1 East Main We have one hand raised for this public hearing and that is Teresa Teresa
25:43
you can speak whenever you're ready
25:54
Um Teresa's hand seems to be lowered now Okay
26:04
All right Um can I get a motion and a second to close the public hearing Motion Second So George and Amber Any
26:11
discussion on the motion to close Uh hearing none All in favor of closing this public hearing say I I Anyone
26:19
opposed Okay So let's do the second one Again uh I am permitted to open the
26:25
public hearing which I will do And this is a public hearing concerning uh regulations which are zoning ones for
26:32
either drive-thru facilities and or self storage businesses And again either
26:37
Natalie or Nick can you just describe to the public uh what we're looking at here Yep I can take this one Thank you
26:44
Natalie Um so at the same meeting on February 24th uh the council did review a draft local law um and that local law
26:51
is amending chapter uh 223 regarding permitted uses Um so the two permitted
26:57
uses um are drive-through facilities as an accessory use and uh self- storage
27:02
facilities So the proposed local law um eliminates drive-thru facilities um in
27:09
all zoning districts So currently drive-through facilities are prohibited only in the CMS and the linkage district
27:16
and the proposed local law eliminates them um in all And then for self-s
27:21
storage businesses uh self-s storage businesses are currently permitted in the general business or the GB light
27:29
industrial LI and the heavy industrial HI zoning districts and the proposed
27:35
local law um eliminates them in all zoning districts So those are the that's
27:41
the local law before you Um the board does similarly have uh a recommendation
27:47
from the planning board dated March 14th Um so their commentary um similar to
27:55
that that they gave to the Fishkill Avenue committee um is that the boards encouraged more specific approach Um
28:01
rather than kind of categorically prohibiting these uses um their recommendation was to identify areas
28:08
within the city of Beacon either on a district by district approach or by looking at areas within individual
28:14
zoning districts uh where that you should be prohibited rather than kind of a blanket approach And then Nick I don't
28:20
know did we get um county comments on this I didn't have that in my records I'm sorry We do and that's included in
28:26
the agenda packet It also indicates it's a matter of local concern
28:32
Okay that's it All right Um so let me open the public
28:38
hearing and go down the list of those who signed up If you didn't sign up don't worry Um after we get through
28:44
those and you'd like to make a comment on this particular public hearing uh just let us know So the first one on the
28:50
on the sign up list is Sergey Caracov
28:58
Good evening again Sergey Krassic of W 3 Um I want to express my strong support for proposed local law to eliminate
29:05
drive-throughs facilities as a permitted use Drive-throughs are not inherently bad They were invented to address the
29:11
needs we have that of convenience I had on occasion use drive-throughs and would again in the future This is not to
29:18
discount environmental and societal costs they may carry Many other things we depend on do so too To me the main
29:26
question is where the drive-throughs add more value to the community than the potential negative impacts I would argue
29:34
that the more urbanized the area is the more the balance tips towards negative impacts Urbanized areas mean higher
29:40
densities continuous buildings along narrower streets high pedestrian and bike use volumes occasional or regular
29:47
traffic congestions In these settings there is a number of negative impacts the drive-throughs have on the community
29:53
conflicts with pedestrian movement by creating additional curb cuts and vehicle crossings across
29:58
sidewalks Requires large land area for queuing lanes that could use can be used more efficiently Disrupts urban fabric
30:05
Prioritizes carcentric design of a pedestrian oriented development Contradicts transit oriented development
30:12
goals Creates traffic management issues including potential queuing into public streets Reduces opportunities for active
30:19
street frontage increases vehicle idling contributing to localized air pollution and emissions in areas with already
30:25
concentrated traffic Next let's consider Beacon If Beacon is urban or envisioned
30:31
as urban enough to have ne negative impacts of drive-throughs outweigh the potential
30:36
benefits Our city code recognizes that Beacon is an urban space with wording
30:42
such as will contribute to creating more urban pedestrian friendly quality in the
30:47
face of population growth urbanization and technological change urban forestry
30:52
enhancing urban form as recommended in the city of Beacon comprehensive plan Both 2007 and 2017 comprehensive
31:01
plans which are the closest we have to shared community vision of what our city
31:06
is and should be have multiple references consistent with urban planning The general tendency is clear
31:13
higher density and more urban fuel along main corridors and gateway areas
31:19
For example 2007 plan promotes an urban form of urban form that prioritizes
31:25
efficient land use with emphasis on compact mixed use development at higher densities which drive-throughs generally
31:31
do not support The plan explicitly references smart growth principles which typically favor walkable communities and
31:38
discourage outer dependent developments like drive-throughs 2017 plan emphasizes
31:44
highquality urban design and buildings that face the street advocates for improvements that in that reduce vehicle
31:51
emissions and promote clean air repeatedly highlights Beacon's walkable
31:57
scale as a community asset Let's keep it that way Please pass the legislation
32:02
Thank you Thank you Uh next on the list is Joanna Funnel
32:12
Hi Sorry crooked voice Uh Joanna Funnel um for resident Um I was going to come
32:20
here tonight to speak about the rail trail but I decided to um talk about drive-throughs instead um because this
32:26
is a major topic of conversation But to segue between those two topics I think
32:31
it makes complete sense to me that we would want to restrict um drive things like drive-throughs and self- storage um
32:37
along proximity to a flagship rail trail for the city and the county This is similar to what Atlanta has just
32:44
recently done in its beltline district If you don't know what that is it's a 22mi um repurposed rail corridor Closer
32:51
to home if you look at News um and the way that they've developed businesses along their stretch of the Walkeill rail
32:57
trail um it couldn't be further from a drive-through model Thinking about places like Water Street Market which is
33:03
a an old lumberyard it's a pedestrianized place It's somewhere you want to hang out You can grab a coffee
33:08
um listen to some music buy some plants if you want but it has a real sense of purpose and place Speaking more broadly
33:15
on drive-throughs and Beacon we're a compact city We're just under five square miles Um we're blessed to not be
33:24
part of the suburban sprawl that covers a lot of America So we can go get our coffees and food by foot by bike by bus
33:30
by car whatever we want We don't need drive-throughs But if you do want to go to a drive-thru I will just say that
33:37
there are at least 10 of them within a six mile radius It's not very far to get to them But because of our compactness
33:43
also it means that our land is precious We don't have that much of it And so I think we need to think very deliberately
33:49
about what businesses we do want on there and we do put on there Um and
33:55
here's the thing about drive-throughs I know they're pretty popular with customers and franchisees alike but
34:00
their successes are often built on the cost to others They don't often make long-term good community assets And to
34:07
paraphrase urban planners they're gener they're generating profits by sucking the value out of the land around them
34:15
They suck value by making roads inefficient and wasting people's time by having to take longer journeys They suck
34:21
value by making the built environment less desirable and less safe for pedestrians to walk on They suck value
34:28
by generating less tax revenue per acre than traditional business businesses might They suck value by diminishing a
34:36
sense of distinct character for communities And they often crowd out other businesses that communities might
34:42
want more of So for instance I know that people often say they want more recreational businesses or activity
34:48
centers that we can't fit on Main Street but we could very well do on 52 So I support um the proposed ban on
34:56
drive-throughs um in Beacon and I support a less sprawling autocentric
35:02
Fishkill Avenue for Beacon Thank you very much Thank you Uh Beatric Clay
35:15
I'm here to talk about Oh sorry I'm here to talk about the drive-thru on
35:21
5th Fishkill Avenue I am also opposing not to have it
35:27
done if possible because I'm thinking about the congestion that going to be happening on
35:34
52 certain afternoons or early mornings hard to get on there There's so much
35:39
traffic going back and forth and I think having it there will be um detrimental
35:46
to a lot of people Lot of accident may happen driving in and out people walking
35:52
the guys from the Edgewood they always be walking there in their wheelchair I
35:58
think won't be a problem for them also and I am hoping that you will
36:04
reconsider that venture Thanks Thank you
36:10
Um Thomas [Music]
36:18
Wright Good evening Thomas Wright 24 Grove Street I would like to add my
36:23
voice to those in support of the proposed local law that would eliminate drive-through facilities as a permitted
36:29
use in all zoning districts I believe you should feel confident in your vote to adopt this local law because there is
36:36
ample rationale for it Perhaps the best summary of this rationale has been provided by the conservation advisory
36:43
committee in its memo dated 31 January of this year stating its strong opposition to the proposed drive-thru at
36:51
420 430 Fishkill Avenue The memo cited significant safety and traffic hav
36:57
hazards fundamental conflict with climate action goals public health and environmental impacts as well as
37:03
economic and community development impacts One key item from this section
37:09
on public health and environmental impacts reminds us that 12 idle vehicles in a drive-thru generates 50 pounds of
37:16
carbon dioxide per hour of operation not to mention the other toxins contained in
37:21
the vehicle exhaust This pollution is a direct result of the business operations and as a result
37:27
drive-throughs should be prohibited by zoning in the same way that it prohibits an aluminum smelter from setting up shop
37:34
in a residential neighborhood Further rationale can be found in the recommendations of the Fishkill Avenue
37:40
concepts committee which are part of this evening's agenda packet The committee concludes that drive-throughs
37:47
are quote not consistent with the overall pedestrian scale vision that the committee is working on working towards
37:54
and further recommends that quote drive-thru facilities standalone or used in conjunction in connection with other
38:00
uses be expressly prohibited within all zoning districts along the Fishkill Avenue corridor End quote I would also
38:08
point to the local electrification law that went into effect in January of last year We cannot on the one hand
38:14
effectively ban fossil fuels in new construction and major renovations and on the other hand embrace vehicle
38:19
centered designs in new construction and major renovations and an and embrace
38:25
which results in the increased use of automobiles which in New York state are responsible for a third of state
38:31
greenhouse gas emissions Finally there is a scoping plan of the uh the scoping
38:36
plan of the CLCPA aka New York's climate law which encourages municipalities to
38:42
embrace walkability and bikeability as a key way to reduce our dependence on cars and the greenhouse gas pollution they
38:48
emit In this context embracing drive-throughs is a really bad look
38:56
Please do what New York State Beacon's own legislative history and its committees are encouraging you to do and
39:02
vote to pass the proposed law to prohibit drive-throughs in Beacon Thank
39:07
you Thank you Uh Taylor Palmer
39:22
good evening Uh for the record Taylor Palmer with the law firm of Cuddy and Feder on behalf of DKH realy uh and
39:28
everyone knows him in the community Healey given the time limit tonight we're submitting written comments that we enclosed our February 10th and
39:33
February 13th submission and we do incorporate our February 18th uh work session comments for the record of proceedings for this public hearing
39:40
Since we last spoke of note um uh on March 11th so last Tuesday uh the
39:45
planning board approved Helaley's application uh for a lot merger and site plan approval which proposes to adaptively reuse the existing car
39:51
dealership at 420 Fishkill Avenue for a fully zoning compliant mixeduse development including a Duncan coffee
39:57
house uh with permitted accessory drive-thru additional commercial space and residential units uh on the second
40:02
floor The project received uh numerous uh pieces of public support which we have submitted in those letters and I
40:07
believe uh will probably be referenced later uh in the meeting which don't align with the fact excuse me the Fisk Avenue committee's statements to the
40:14
contrary uh include some important inclusions like a future rail connection uh which was mentioned this evening uh
40:20
just that a walk up window as well uh crosswalks and other pedestrian and landscape improvements all for the
40:25
former car dealership um we're greening up the space for the council's ease of reference in our most recent letter we
40:30
did cite to the planning board's March 11th discuss discussion about this local law I believe was mentioned this evening by uh the city attorney and the planner
40:37
Uh of note we would highlight the planning board did not support prohibiting drive-throughs in all
40:42
districts in the city Rather the general consensus was that drive-thru uses made sense in certain areas These are their
40:49
words and more specifically within certain areas and sections along Fischell Avenue as referenced in the image in front of you The planning board
40:55
also suggested that the city council take a hard look at where drive-throughs could be permitted including soliciting feedback from the city's traffic
41:01
consultant and not just a committee Accordingly we respectfully request that the city consider the planning board's thoughtful recommendations and undertake
41:08
a more comprehensive review and analysis before acting on this local law Healey has been and remains committed to
41:14
long-term corporate citizenship in the city of Beacon but these so-called quick fixes are not supported by your city's
41:20
comprehensive plan They need further review and consultation with traffic experts not a a committee's incomplete
41:26
recommendations to prohibit same and the fuller context of this whole city So on behalf of the Healey's who are working
41:31
to reinvigorate this corridor with pedestrian connections a crosswalk directly to Townson Street trail
41:37
linkages to the potential future rail trail that doesn't exist at this time but hopefully will We ask the council to
41:42
consider the following if it decides to still move forward with this law Instead of prohibition of this drive of
41:48
drive-through uses the council might for example consider grandfathering in a drive-through component specifically for
41:53
an application that's reviewed and approved by your planning board that was reviewed by your traffic experts for pedestrian and traffic safety or simply
42:02
creating a special permit regulation for these types of uses drive-throughs in the rear only screening public benefits
42:08
rail trail linkages things that you can all control and make sure that the planning board would have to implement There are ways to do that You could also
42:14
prohibit for example fast food restaurants specifically at fast excuse me drive-throughs at fast food restaurants instead of coffee houses
42:20
They're distinctly distinct uses in your your code or enable drive elapsed Thank you Just if I may the first application
42:27
for this is the first application the city has seen in the last decades for a drive-thru So what's the rush especially
42:33
when the project was reviewed and approved by your planning board Thank you Thank you Thank you Clark
42:38
Uh Clark stay up there You're next Can I hold it It was a setup Yeah
42:46
You know he's a nice guy you know um if it was
42:51
me what I tell you is you're really subject to being
42:58
sued because CarMax has a drive-thru in its frontage That's what the sign says
43:05
Now I remember when they appeared they said they weren't going to do commercial business or people foot traffic and all
43:11
that but that's what that lane is right in front drive through this way to drop off your
43:17
car What about the car wash It's a drive-thru So first of all I'm not happy
43:26
with underinvestment per lineal foot tax value on a commercial property
43:32
I think this is an underinvestment But the issue on
43:38
drivethru okay that's the worst place in the world to opine that you can restrict it The case
43:46
law for zoning is very clear with these adjoining
43:52
uses potentially you you could Now I understand Healey is a nice guy You're talking to him and you're planning the
43:58
world Okay uh in in that little part of Route 52 but it it's you really need to
44:08
have on staff some people who really really know what they're doing about these hyper technical
44:15
issues and it would be much less expensive for the old taxpayers in the
44:21
city to begin preliminary conversations about what they can and can't build
44:28
You literally have two three four 500 units of housing at the opportunity of
44:35
empowering homeowners in this city to do something with their land without having
44:41
to gamble a second mortgage of 10 20 30 $40,000 to have the professional
44:48
documents when a employee of the city should be there ready to say "You know
44:53
what I think we can talk and we'll talk around We we'll do it You you you are
44:58
perpetually creating a roadblock to take effectively the assets
45:05
the generational wealth the people who have good fortune to be here for a long time and you're putting a toll booth up
45:12
from them being able to realize generational wealth or for the children to live
45:18
nearby And it's all done under the opaces of making people feel belittled
45:23
and lowly that well they don't understand these complicated things Okay It's called politics It's called land
45:30
use politics and it really ought to stop for the benefit of the citizens of this
45:36
city Thank you Um so is there anyone in the physical audience that would like to
45:41
make a comment about in this public hearing So again about the zoning
45:47
proposals with respect to either drive-throughs or um storage facilities
45:53
self storage So um as a dentist
46:05
Sure Well I uh I'd just like to say
46:11
um during CO how did every how did everybody eat H how did you eat when
46:18
when you went to fast food You couldn't go in You couldn't go inside and eat You had to go to the drive-thru What did I
46:24
say Drive-thru That is correct The drive-thru Drive-in movie theaters uh
46:30
abound They were the only place you could go to when you wanted to watch a movie You couldn't go to a movie
46:35
theater You had to go to the drive-thru if you wanted to go get fast food And everyone to the north of us has a
46:42
drive-thru and a Dunkin Donuts It's part of it's part of their business It's who they are It's what they do and what kind
46:49
of revenue they're making for the town of Fishkill I'd like to see the city of Beacon make the same kind of revenue
47:02
here And with going back years ago when I
47:08
was I pretty much lived here 20 years attended every meeting I'm
47:14
not trying to toot my own horn but however I attended a lot of zoning board and planning board meetings and when the
47:22
when the person that came with the project before the board didn't have enough
47:28
uh their setback that was somehow okay And their project continue
47:36
to move forward I don't know why
47:42
we're limiting commercial businesses when they thrive in the
47:50
business that they only know what to what to do and how they're doing it If a drive-thru is going to create more
47:57
revenue for a city town or village what is the
48:02
big deal about having more revenue generated in the that's going to go to
48:10
the tax base And I understand the don't get me wrong I understand the pollution
48:15
in the cars but a lot of people don't want to go through the drive-thru They go in some that are got to go to work
48:21
and they're on their way to work they want to go to the drive-thru Quick in and out in or they're out But I just I
48:27
just have a hard time uh with this uh how we're limiting
48:33
commercial businesses on what they can and what they can't have I I I I don't even believe we have a public hearing
48:39
regarding it I just think it's you know I just think it's uh you know um it
48:45
shouldn't be it shouldn't be that we got to limit limit commercial business and
48:52
they have enough of uh of uh land to have a drive-thru where it's not going to be
48:59
affecting traffic and there's going to be crosswalks and your time is elapsed
49:04
Thank you Thank you very much again Anyone else in the the audience Sure
49:10
Come on up and then the behind him in a
49:20
minute Hi my name is Stuart Weatherby I live at 66 ME Avenue I'm in favor of the
49:27
proposed law to prohibit drive-throughs and self-s storage units I have lived in
49:32
the same address for over 30 years I have watched Beacon's transformation
49:38
from a city with a boarded up main street and depressed housing market to one of the most vibrant and desirable
49:45
places to live in the Hudson Valley Although little has been done infrastructure infrastructure-wise
49:52
to the Fishkill Avenue corridor I always felt like it was a matter of time and
49:57
that time has come I've heard Route 52 called the backway into Beacon or the highway into
50:05
Beacon but I see it as a gateway into Beacon The Fishell Avenue Committee was
50:13
formed that was formed by the mayor has been working hard with a lot of public
50:18
input to recommend long and short-term development strategies
50:23
One of the things they are working on is making the corridor less car ccentric
50:29
and more pedestrian and bike friendly which seems to have a lot of public
50:36
support The committee has stated that drive-throughs and self storage would not fit well into this planning and
50:43
should be prohibited This is one of the last places in Beacon to be redeveloped and truly a gateway
50:51
into our great city I urge the council to pass this law and keep Fishkill
50:57
Avenue from becoming a strip of drive-throughs and self-s storage units
51:03
Thank you Thank you
51:09
Come on up
51:15
Hi thank you I am Katie Helmouth of Ward One I don't have any speech prepared I
51:21
was listening at home while making dinner for my kids I'm speaking in favor of the drive-thru um to have them If I
51:27
had time to start a mother's in favor of drive-thru group I would do so I am
51:33
still in kid pickup zone right now I have three kids and I'm picking up my last one at 9:00 So driving with
51:40
children is very important to me Driving with parents and grandparents and people who really don't walk that well is
51:46
something that I do often I think it's um dismissive of people who need to drive to say no drive-throughs just go
51:54
to a little artisal coffee shop I think it's dismissive of people who are doing
51:59
laundry right there It adds value to people who are doing laundry to walk over to the Dunkin Donuts and go and get
52:07
a donut and get coffee instead of being judgmental about which coffee shop they should go to to snack up before they do
52:14
these errands There's all kinds of people who live here all kinds of different people who do not have a lot
52:19
of time and we need to just drive there and get it And I know it's ideal that we
52:24
should be riding our bikes but we're not all riding our bikes We have soccer equipment We have elderly parents and we
52:31
have a lot of stuff in our cars I'm also concerned that the move to outzone auto businesses
52:38
along that corridor is just being done Um it's really shocking to me if
52:44
anything should happen to those businesses like if it should burn down more than 50% as I understand it they
52:50
might not be able to build back up because that's I mean please correct me if that if I'm misunderstanding that Um
52:58
otherwise I'm just here to say that it adds value Drive-throughs adds value to my life I am a biker I am a jogger on a
53:06
daily basis So I get it and I get we need to be aware of the climate but we
53:12
are driving And we need coffee and donuts Thanks Bye
53:17
Um again anyone else in the physical public want to make a comment about this public
53:24
hearing Okay Um so Ben anyone uh in the
53:30
remote part of the meeting Uh we have one hand raised and that's Teresa Teresa
53:35
you have permission to speak whenever you're ready Thank you I just want to start by saying
53:42
please let us have our three minutes without interruption In the context of the planning and ideologies of on the
53:48
recently proposed Fishkill Avenue concepts it is imperative to acknowledge that Route 52 functions as a significant
53:56
commercial corridor and is one of only two designated trucking routes into our
54:02
city In strategic decisionmaking I have opted to support the inclusion of the
54:08
drive-throughs in the planning cycle while continuing to advocate for the exclusion of recreational bicycles on
54:15
Route 52 at all costs Let's keep everyone safe Looking to the future
54:20
there may be a necessity for additional drive-throughs along Route 52 as the
54:25
community continues to develop Moreover our city needs to aim for the establishment of a comprehensive
54:31
hospital facility perhaps a sat satellite complex that could adequately serve the needs of our residents rather
54:38
than relying on small storefront clinics located in hightra areas such as those
54:43
on Main Street I am strongly opposed to allowing storage unit facilities in the city of Beacon Before long you might
54:50
propose turning them into tiny apartments As we navigate these complex issues it is essential to strike an
54:57
appropriate balance between development and community needs Therefore the timely
55:02
update of the city comprehensive plan must be prioritized at the top of the list to ensure that it aligns with the
55:09
involving requirements of our residents and promote sustainable growth in the coming years ahead not far too far into
55:16
the future The city needs to curb the continuation of overdevelopment By
55:21
taking these steps we can cultivate a thriving and well ststructured environment for all Beacon residents If
55:27
only the recent public presentation on the proposed Fiskll Avenue redesign drew the same crowd that the Newberg brewery
55:34
drew last weekend with Cohed and Cohabra tour Rock on Let's protect the work of
55:40
the founding fathers of Madawan Village Thank you Good night Thank you Anyone
55:46
else online Ben Yes Meg uh has hand raised Meg you have permission to speak
55:52
whenever you're ready Hi there Um Meg Lazarus again Ward One resident member
55:57
of Beacon Climate Action Now and Beacon Bicycle Coalition I'm also a parent of
56:02
two small children and I'm speaking in favor of the proposed local law concerning use regulations for
56:08
drive-thru facilities and self- storage businesses As we've seen here um you have lots of residents showing up time
56:14
and time again um to council in opposition of drive-throughs on Fishkill Avenue The CAC also has strongly advised
56:21
not to allow drive-throughs in our city because of the detrimental environmental effects they would have And the FAC has
56:28
come out in opposition to drive-throughs which is stated in their me memo sent to city council regarding zoning
56:34
recommendations Um honestly I don't know I feel for all of you sitting up there on council I can't even begin to
56:41
understand what it's like to sit there and have everyone come at you from different uh vantage points But I think
56:47
at the end of the day you know it's your job to do what's best for the community at large and the big vision the big
56:53
picture the long game you know and at the end of the day I think you know you just each have to ask yourself what is
56:59
your vision for a better beacon Uh I'm hoping that you'll listen to what our
57:05
community has to say and the trusted various commu committees that have been
57:10
fighting for to pass these regulations around drive-throughs and storage facilities Thank you Thank you
57:21
No further hands raised on Zoom Okay Um so I'm looking Mayor we have one
57:29
late hand Okay let's do it ML you have permission to speak whenever you're ready
57:36
Thank you Um I just want to um say that
57:42
I'm not a Dunkin Donuts um fan myself Um
57:48
and I understand that even I live right next to this uh proposal I understand
57:54
that a lot of people are against it including some of my neighbors and I
58:01
personally am totally fine with it I know that some other neighbors are totally fine with it I know that there
58:07
are a lot of people in the city that really want Dunkin Donuts Um I just am
58:14
without saying do it or don't do it I want to make sure that when you're making your decision that you have
58:20
really listened to our planning board and their comments about how zoning is
58:27
being done right now How peacemill it is how reactionary it is I agree with
58:34
Teresa that we have to reo the comprehensive plan and it zoning is
58:41
supposed to reflect the comprehensive plan And last thing I will say is a lot
58:47
of people I heard say I'm fine with one drive-thru but there's going to be a lot
58:54
of them This project was already approved by the planning board and if
58:59
you're going to pass the law I um I I urge you to think about giving
59:06
them a grandfathering them in And please I do not want to agree with Taylor
59:12

replay I think we have the presentation available on the website And I thank the committee for their um thoughtfulness
1:03:00
and thoroughess in thinking through um and and taking in some of the public
1:03:06
input in this area So just appreciate their efforts and um that's all from me today
1:03:12
Thank you I will try not to repeat um and just but I will say thank you to
1:03:19
everyone um who spoke We will be discussing all of um that feedback including comments that we received um
1:03:26
via email at our next workshop in two weeks If you're listening and wondering why we didn't discuss any of this at all
1:03:32
um we're reserving that conversation for for our next workshop Um and because it is a um there are five Mondays in March
1:03:40
our next workshop will not be for another two weeks Um so March 31st Um
1:03:46
otherwise I'll say thank you to those who came to my office hours um this past Sunday I had some really great
1:03:52
conversations and my next open office hours um will be in just another two
1:03:58
weeks on Sunday April 5th um from 4 to 6 PM and I'm moving um to this side of
1:04:04
town I'll be at Bank Square Coffee House Thanks Good evening
1:04:10
Um thank you all for for attending and comments on the public hearings Um I did
1:04:18
listen to the planning board and I know we've been wanting to try to
1:04:24
uh get together with them I'm proposing that maybe the city council and the
1:04:31
mayor could attend their planning board me meeting either in April or May for
1:04:37
that first 30 minutes um because it's clear that the planning board also kind
1:04:42
of has questions for us and concerns um of us bringing things to them So I
1:04:50
really think we we need to have a discussion Um but I want to thank the
1:04:55
planning board Um I really appreciated their input on both public hearing
1:05:01
comments Um and it really had you know there was some comments made that I
1:05:07
think we need to rethink Um you know especially the the one East Main Street
1:05:12
to to kind of look at things um you know take what they had said into consideration not just on paper but um
1:05:20
what they verbally were speaking about Um and then also I don't have um office
1:05:28
hours but you are more than happy to reach me at pw weatherbe at uh beaconnew
1:05:34
york.gov and more than willing to um find a great time to meet with anyone
1:05:40
who wants to Thank you Good evening First I'd like to say happy
1:05:46
St Patrick's Day to everybody Um and Amber you be being to it I was going to
1:05:51
uh thank all those that um organized the parade of green as well as you deserve two thank yous Well yeah And uh you know
1:05:58
they were both very well attended and they're a great uh contribution to the community But what they both have in
1:06:04
common is it's uh organized by volunteers and volunteerism in this city is
1:06:12
unbelievable The amount of generosity and people that give uh back to their community um it's the core of this
1:06:20
community So I really want to say is just thank you to all the volunteers for all they do and continue to do So
1:06:28
thanks Um so I'll do two comments I know Chris
1:06:33
has a couple of updates as well The the first one um was about the planning board's
1:06:40
comments and I wasn't surprised by the set regarding uh drive-thru and self- storage but um they were absolutely
1:06:47
right with respect to East Maine that the dimensional aspects of the zoning need to be considered as well as the use
1:06:54
aspects And this goes to a larger issue and I I just got to think how we present it to council and I'd like to have a
1:07:02
meeting with my uh city attorney and our planner on this at some point But our
1:07:08
whole structure of zoning is not as fit for purpose as it used to be Um we used
1:07:16
to have you know heavy industry and light industry and we used to think light industry was was not quite a
1:07:21
factory but kind of close our our uses are are merging and I think our zones
1:07:30
put them into categories that don't always make sense That was very clear to me when we discussed um the setback
1:07:37
requirements and I was noting that some of our R1s that's single family zones um
1:07:43
excluded 60% of the ter of the property from development by having very large
1:07:49
setbacks and that's doesn't make a lot of sense in terms of being environmentally sustainable Now the
1:07:56
third element so the uses seem to be like mixed uh in ways that we weren't
1:08:01
expecting the setbacks seem different because we're looking at sustainability and now the other forms of the
1:08:06
dimensional regulations also need to have be rethought a little bit I don't know how to do that yet but I want to
1:08:13
come to you all with some ideas on that right because we're seeing this with some frequency Um you know if we do um
1:08:22
something with respect to self storage I'll pick the one that's less controversial if we do it by the zones
1:08:29
they don't quite fit what we're thinking I think Um so anyway just that's the first comment That's just musing The
1:08:36
other one is I do want uh to provide a little information on the traffic situation on northbound 9D Um I don't
1:08:44
know if you've any of you have noticed but it's better um with the help of
1:08:50
Assemblyman Jacobson we have been um very firmly um talking with the state
1:08:56
DOT and talking is I guess the right word but we're not going away And we
1:09:02
kept coming to the table saying we've got a significant northbound problem uh with traffic on 90 And in particular
1:09:09
it's the train uh the commuter trains coming out trying to turn left onto um
1:09:15
the westbound bridge The other issue we've been raising is very specifically in addition to the general problem the
1:09:23
signal at Verplank and90 has just been wrong for some period of time Um I want
1:09:30
to give credit to DOT Uh they've done two things One is they look very
1:09:35
carefully at the Verplank intersection um and they put in another camera and I think it's made a significant difference
1:09:41
on that intersection That particular intersection um would stop traffic for
1:09:47
two cars on Verplank uh instead of allowing the traffic to flow northbound
1:09:52
to get onto that bridge Um that intersection is actually now timed with
1:09:59
um all five from 84 down to Beakman Um
1:10:04
is that 5 1 2 whatever it is might be four depends on how you count the ones at I84 They have a what's called an
1:10:11
adaptive signal system that they've just put into place They had it originally set up with sensors on the ground They
1:10:17
decided they wanted to do cameras They installed the cameras They switched it on and I've seen some data on it Now I
1:10:24
don't want to say we have a solution that's great but from what I can tell it has improved And what this system does
1:10:30
is it can tell if there's northbound a large flow of traffic It times all of
1:10:36
the lights longer heading northbound to allow that traffic to turn left onto the the bridge Uh it does the opposite as
1:10:43
well If it senses that the offramp from the bridge is starting to fill up such
1:10:49
that there might be cars ending up on the bridge itself in those lanes it will
1:10:54
then switch the lights to allow the uh off-ramp from the bridge a longer signal
1:11:00
And I'm seeing data because they're showing us data as they measure that during the commuting rush hours the
1:11:06
signals heading north go longer uh and that the rest of the time they go back to normal In fact on average it's about
1:11:13
the same length of time It's just increasing it during heavy traffic northbound and decreasing it otherwise
1:11:20
Uh I'm encouraged that this is making a difference Um my my one test subject is
1:11:26
the city administrator who goes home to New Pulse daily uh and thinks it clearly
1:11:31
is improved I know the intersection at Verplank is clearly improved So I'll just ask folks see what you think Um
1:11:39
we're going to get some more data but I I think we've had the first improvement on that in a long time So and I'll turn
1:11:45
it over to the city administrator Um so I just have three announcements Last week we began um remobilizing for
1:11:54
the Fishkill Ter Avenue project That's a $9 million project to upgrade um that
1:11:59
entire roadway including replacing all sidewalks Um doing all new curbs and
1:12:05
then eventually repaving Um they are going to be finishing Teller Avenue over the next month or two and then repaving
1:12:11
that whole section And then they're going to be jumping to Fishkill Avenue where they'll be finishing what they
1:12:17
started last year and then also beginning work on the replacement of the sidewalks between Blackburn Avenue and
1:12:23
Mil Street Um so we're hoping to be done by July Uh Ben can you put up the water
1:12:29
meter I just wanted to remind people that we are still in the midst of a water meter upgrade for the uh radio
1:12:36
transistors on the uh water meters throughout the city Um we have sent um
1:12:42
two letters now and we are getting close to a deadline which is April 1st Um most
1:12:47
people have either already had their water meter replaced out or they have
1:12:53
scheduled the appointment the appointment If you have an appointment there's no penalty So please call the
1:12:59
number on this sheet It's
1:13:05
877-8608376 877-8608376 and you will be talking to
1:13:10
VEPO to set up a meeting to have your transistor changed If you don't respond
1:13:16
to this we are going to have to put a $250 penalty on each quarter continuing
1:13:22
until your meter is changed out So um again we we have a number of people that
1:13:28
still haven't responded Um if you haven't changed out your meter or arranged an appointment don't wait for a
1:13:35
letter Just please call that number Um and then finally on a nicer note
1:13:41
um we are um doing our tree purchasing program for backyard trees We did a
1:13:47
pilot of this last year and we sold about three dozen trees at one half the
1:13:53
retail cost These are delivered to your your home Um we we get them at a at a
1:13:59
bulk discount We deliver them to your house and you would be responsible for planting it Um we have sold 31 of the
1:14:06
available 60 trees and you have a couple more weeks to go on Uh we definitely
1:14:11
have some types that are more popular and we're seeing if we can do a last minute shift Um and then we'll be
1:14:17
delivering these trees in April and that's all I have
1:14:24
Okay Um so we got a one local lawn
1:14:30
resolution So let me get a motion and a second This is a res resolution to refer
1:14:36
a proposed local law regarding zoning and that's referring it to the city of
1:14:41
Beacon Planning Board and the Duchess County Planning Board It concerns accessory apartments Can I get a motion
1:14:47
Motion second So that was Amber and Paloma Before we go further either
1:14:52
Natalie or Nick would you just take us through both that it's a referral and what we're referring Certainly You're
1:14:58
also scheduling the public hearing for April 21st which will allow Duchess County planning board as well as the
1:15:04
city of Beacon Planning Board to review this uh before the public hearing Um the planning board will consider this at
1:15:10
their um April meeting the city's planning board So this local law amends the zoning chapter concerning accessory
1:15:17
apartments In your packet is a memo from the city planner that reviews some of the changes but more significant changes
1:15:23
are that you're permitting accessory um apartments in all zoning districts so
1:15:29
long as it's to an existing detached single family property Um you've also
1:15:34
removed the minimum apartment size um and said that any accessory apartment with a total square footage greater than
1:15:41
30 50% of the primary building footprint uh site plan approval from the planning board is required There are a number of
1:15:47
changes in this law that removes it from the planning board and gives the discretion to the building inspector to
1:15:53
issue the um permits for an accessory dwelling unit and thus removing some
1:15:58
time and cost element for construction of those apartments The change to the local law firm that which you reviewed
1:16:03
last time is modifications to subsections H and I This introduces the
1:16:09
concept in certain instances of an application being referred by the building inspector to the city's
1:16:14
architectural and community appearance board your ARB which is a subset of the planning board members and that occurs
1:16:20
in two instances One it's required when the proposed um use is less than 10 ft
1:16:25
from a property line and within 20 ft of any dwelling unit on an adjacent property And then specifically with
1:16:32
respect to the R1-10 R17.5 and the R15 zoning districts where
1:16:38
the side and rear set bar set back of 5T is required um review by the ARB is
1:16:44
required if the proposed accessory apartment is less than 10 feet from a dwelling unit on an adjacent property
1:16:50
and using the same uh design guidelines as set forth in section H And we've also added the definition of occupied primary
1:16:57
residence and owner Okay Okay So this is all about trying to simplify the
1:17:04
requirements for accessory dwelling units and we are both referring it and setting the public hearing correct for
1:17:10
April 21st Okay Any comments or questions by the council I just wanted
1:17:15
to clarify something I wasn't sure but I thought we decided that for the if you were going to build a accessory dwelling
1:17:21
unit that was more than 50% of the size of the primary unit I didn't I don't
1:17:26
remember us saying that that triggers the site plan review Did we agree on
1:17:32
that And this is in section F on the local law that's in your agenda packet
1:17:38
I thought it was being treated like any other units that it was maximum thousand
1:17:43
square feet regardless of the size of the primary dwelling
1:17:49
Yeah I thought we pulled both the the min and the 50% I thought we pulled them
1:17:55
all because it it basically it subjects person with a smaller house and added
1:18:01
burden of going to the site plan to the planning board right And I don't think that was our intent
1:18:07
Um I can jump in here This is Natalie I'm still on Um so I'm trying to get my
1:18:13
camera to go on Um so there's not a requirement that you have to be less than 50% of the primary
1:18:20
structure but what has been kept or what was retained is that if it if you are
1:18:25
over 50% of the primary structure that that requires review by the ARB right I
1:18:31
think that B or requires review by the planning board So it's not a limitation but based on my notes in the
1:18:37
conversation the last meeting that that planning board review was still required if you are bigger than 50% of the
1:18:44
primary structure Could you could you remind me of the logic of that I don't recall us I think that was what the
1:18:51
conversation we got into around what is accessory and what is primary right And if you start to get equal to in size or
1:18:59
or somewhat closer you know equal to the size of the primary structure are you still accessory or larger than the
1:19:06
structure Are you still an accessory use So I think coming from that conversation deeming these as as they
1:19:12
are defined as accessory apartments that they should still be of a smaller size And so again we're not necessarily
1:19:19
placing that limitation that you must be that you must be less than 50% of the
1:19:24
primary structure But if you're bigger than that that that's something that the planning board may need to look at so that they can deal with this more
1:19:30
nuanced conversation about accessory and primary I mean that's the way I recall it and I was comfortable with that check
1:19:37
for that that case Yeah that reflects my recollection in my notes And when we do
1:19:45
Yeah And I now recall this ARB concept Um if we do something like it are we are
1:19:51
we saying we can ask the planning board to look at it without like full sight plans Um is that what we're kind of
1:19:57
trying to get at I think it has to have a full site plan That's correct And subsection D it
1:20:05
requires site plan approval Yeah Okay Okay And if we're trying to make this easier just uh I guess I just don't
1:20:12
necessarily agree with the logic of you know of size and what's accessory and what's not because probably a small
1:20:19
house in Beacon is probably no less than a thousand square feet I guess So the
1:20:25
accessory would be equal to or less than even the smallest house So I just don't
1:20:32
Would you like for planning board to be asked to offer an opinion on that specific section Sounds great Yeah Yeah
1:20:39
Okay Because then you can you know workshop and make further revisions when it comes back to you Okay So is the what
1:20:46
we could have done it was an amendment before we refer right Um but what the suggestion on the table if that's okay
1:20:53
is to leave it as it is but to inquire the planning board specifically on that item Is that okay Yes All right Do we
1:21:00
need a motion Nick for that No we'll take the direction from the council and then convey that to a planning board
1:21:05
Okay Yeah Yeah And I I think this is one of the areas where we're kind of playing back and forth and having their opinion
1:21:11
I I value that a lot So that'd be great All right Any other comments on this No
1:21:17
All right So all in favor of referring the ADU uh amendments to both the county
1:21:23
planning board and the city planning board and scheduling the public hearing for April 21st Say I I I Anyone opposed
1:21:31
Okay I am looking for a motion other than from Molly who's not here to approve the minutes I know of of March
1:21:39
3rd Motion second Uh so Paloma and Amber we're just going to have to trust that
1:21:45
there were I'm not going to ask for any comments additions corrections etc Unless you all have some They looked
1:21:50
fine I did not find any Um all in favor say I I Anyone opposed Thank you all Um
1:21:56
I'm glad you uh tolerate my my fun with the minutes Uh this is the second
1:22:02
opportunity for public comment If you had not make a comment previously and would like to do so now this would be
1:22:08
the opportunity Uh anyone in the physical public want to make a comment who didn't
1:22:14
before Seeing no Oh all right Please come on up
1:22:19
Tell us who you are I'm Fran Riley Just very quickly regarding the one east main zoning just
1:22:25
wanted to um re reiterate what Clark had asked which was what are the
1:22:31
implications tax- wise for central versus business versus flight industrial
1:22:37
like we just just don't know sort of what those implications are And I also
1:22:43
let him know that um owners didn't get a survey or anything like that that you know um that the building inspector had
1:22:51
talked to the retail owners So um anyway that's all I want to say and I thank you
1:22:56
a good meeting Okay Um I would simply respond and ordinarily we don't that I
1:23:02
don't think the zoning would have any implication on value uh or on taxation
1:23:08
unless for some reason the reasonzoning dramatically increased the assessed value of the property u which I would
1:23:14
think it would not So but again the assessment is based upon the use of the property Yeah So um okay anyone online
1:23:23
want to make a comment who did not make one before not online Um so the next meeting this
1:23:31
uh which you heard before is not next Monday It is the following Monday It will be a workshop at 7 here Uh next
1:23:39
Monday will be a week off because it is the fourth Monday in a five Monday month And I am looking for a motion to adjurnn
1:23:47
Motion second Uh Pam and Paloma All in favor I Anyone opposed Thank you all and
1:23:54
good night Thanks recording
