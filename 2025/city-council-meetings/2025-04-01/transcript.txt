okay um hey everybody good a good evening we're going to start up so it's
9:13
7 o'clock and uh we have a lot of new folks here so just so you know this is a
9:21
workshop meeting that means it's an informal meeting of the council the council does its Preparatory business
9:28
prior to an official meeting meeting but in these meetings we can also do community segments which is what we're
9:34
going to do so um because it's informal we don't do a pledge we ordinarily do a
9:39
pledge of allegiance to the flags that are behind us but we won't do that this evening because again it's an informal
9:45
meeting I do need to do roll um see who's here on the council so I'll just
9:50
do that next and pardon you can't hear
9:57
me uh any louder okay so that's odd usually I I don't
10:02
have to get anywhere near the mic so that's okay all right good so um as I
10:08
said the first thing I'll do is roll and then we have one announcement that the city administrator has to do and then
10:14
we're going to have a community segment on essay Awards all right so hang on uh
10:19

10:51
want to let's do to after the the other thing uh okay so let me know when you
10:57
want to do it but let's let's remember it so the this will be an announcement concerning water meters which sounds
11:03
very unexciting I can do it I can do it quickly so um we have uh sent out water
11:08
bills for January February and March people that didn't sign up to have their
11:14
water meter transistors replaced are getting an automatic fine of
11:20
$250 we have set a an amnesty of 3 weeks so that if you have this billing on your
11:28
water meter all you need to do is call our company that is doing this switch over which is called Veo I'm going to
11:35
give you that number which is 877 860
11:40
8376 again 877 860 8376 all you need to do is make an
11:48
appointment it can be for late in May it could be in June and then we will reverse the charge on your bill um right
11:56
now about 85% of people have resp responded but we do have uh several
12:01
hundred people that have not responded so if you haven't responded please call that number set up an appointment will
12:08
reverse the charge no questions asked after April 21st that charge will stay
12:14
thank you okay and this is just to encourage people to get the water meter upgrades that we've been doing they'll
12:20
be very cool because you'll be able to see your usage real time you'll be able to get a notice if you can't if you have
12:26
a leak which would be very important for folks that only to get a bill every 3 months okay so I'm going to turn over

it be on a small scale or a large scale many people dream of things such as fame
21:48
or love but society's forward thinkers dream of one thing progress Martin
21:54
Luther King's time was uncertain with rampant racial tension and segregation
21:59
racism was commonplace and often government supported in addition to being able to
22:05
recognize problems a civically aware citizen must be able to engage in critical thoughts surrounding the issue
22:12
and reach different conclusions and SL or come up with propositions to address the problem it is the duty of humanity
22:19
to fight for Freedom unity and hope it is the duty of humanity to stick

31:17
started we're going to start up hey Tom Chief so the next segment uh is for the
31:25
chief of police you've got an annual police police report and I think we've sent it to council and you've got slides
31:32
you want to tee them up are you ready to start Tom I'm ready when you guys
32:14
all right okay I wasn't sure if it was going to go full screen I didn't know if it was still setting up thank you guys
32:19
um so uh as you guys are probably well aware um this is our second annual report that we've done in recent years
32:26
um our last one was a little delayed with a lot of changes uh so we dropped that in I think it was July of last year
32:33
um this year I'm a little more timely I have one for you here at the end of March um and going forward we'll
32:38
continue to do this to kind of highlight and make the community aware of what the department is doing and what's going on with the department so um it's a fairly
32:46
in-depth report um so what we did was we went ahead and made a slideshow uh kind of hitting each of the major points and
32:52
then if you guys have questions I don't know if you guys want to do it as we go at the end what's the the preference
32:59
from the counil to the end have okay all right so um go ahead and hit
33:05
the first slide so the first section of the report
33:10
talks about Community participation um creating opportunities for department members to interact with
33:16
the public in capacities other in strict law enforcement encounters is critical to the Department's efforts these
33:21
opportunities go a long way helping to Foster trust between department members and the public that we serve uh times of great stress or crisis
33:29
recognizing responding officers from previous Pleasant interactions can go a very long way in De escalating a
33:36
situation um we can go next
33:47
slide so in 2024 we uh participated in about 31 community events I listed most
33:52
of them in the actual report um either through providing dedicated Police Services traffic control are simply
33:58
being present for community relations such as what we do with the um bike rodeos and stuff like that and we also
34:04
actually relaunched our bike Patrol on Main Street to enhance our community
34:11
presence the next one the next topic we covered is
34:17
Staffing um as you guys are very well aware we're budgeted for 36 members and
34:22
six civilian staff we also contract with full-time behavioral specialist from
34:27
Mental Health America and a part-time domestic violence victims advocate is co-housed in police
34:33
station this year we experiened unprecedent staff movement and under Staffing in 2024 we also took
34:39
significant efforts to improve recruiting and retention and streamline hiring and in 2025 the current PBA
34:45
contract will expire and we'll have to do more work to bolster our staffing go to the next
34:52
slide went through some notable police incidents um I didn't have a picture of this because there
34:58
not really fun incidents um there's a lot of them in the report I kind of hit some of the highlights um in 2024 we
35:05
continued hard work to address and resolve a number of significant incidents and crimes some of the most notable would be the arrest of a man who
35:11
was actively vandalizing businesses on Main Street locating a 15-year-old with a loaded handgun um arresting a suspect
35:18
who had seriously assaulted a homeless victim making an arrest in hate crimes assault U making two active arson
35:24
arrests meaning the arson were actually in progress when we interrupted them uh resolving a suicidal female who is
35:30
holding a knife to her throat and making multiple arrests in the 2022 murder of
35:35
lion pment our Police Department also
35:41
participates with Duchess County drug task force we assign a detective to The Duchess County District Attorney's drug
35:47
task force the mission of the task force is to apprehend dangerous drug dealers throughout Duchess County with a focus
35:53
on reducing violent crime and overdose deaths several dangerous drug dealers um who either sold drugs or resided in
36:00
Beacon were arrested in 2024 the most significant of which was a fentanyl dealer with a previous conviction for
36:05
possession of an explosive um he was found to be in possession of a felony weight drugs and also an illegal gun
36:12
which is pictured there um and also one of the things that I do want to highlight the task force has been
36:18
bringing up um overdose deaths in D's County were extremely high in 2023 um the task force kind of revised
36:24
we actually had a press conference with the DA's office recently kind of revised their way of operating to kind of process cases a lot faster and right now
36:31
Duchess County is seeing about a 50% reduction in those those stats we think it has a lot to do with that work that
36:37
they're doing to try to interrupt the sale of this fental products to the next
36:44
slide this year I included in the report some statistics for Mental Health America it goes into more detail in the
36:50
report but our behavioral specialist corresponded with us to 184 calls for service and completed 130 follow-ups
36:58
114 individuals were um linked with post police call services including mental health treatment treatment providers
37:04
case management crisis shelters and substance abuse treatment can go to next training um in
37:12
the report I went into kind of detailed all of the training that we did for the year a lot of our inservice training was the same as we did last year um as you
37:19
guys know we meet or exceed the state standards uh in just about every area that's required um this year all of our
37:26
staff completed all of our mandat training successfully um and in 2025 going into 2025 we're going to need to
37:32
maintain kind of a high pace of training due to our staff turnover people in new positions new hires and so on so forth
37:39
you what it is um one initiative that we actually
37:45
got online in 2024 was our parking enforcement equipment initiative I think if anybody reads the internet you know
37:51
uh that we do a terrible job of enforcing parking and to be quite Frank uh in in 20 23 into 2024 we were not
37:59
doing a great job and we were very hampered by some really bad equipment that we had a contract for um this year
38:05
we turn that around uh we changed our vendor to provide these backend services and they also Chang the vendor the
38:10
vendor provides a much better uh piece of equipment for actually riding the ticket so now when an officer goes out
38:16
to try to ride a park car on Main Street it doesn't take them 5 10 unsuccessful tries to get a ticket out they can do it
38:22
in one try um and as such our parking ticket numbers have have really increased a lot you know from from
38:28
double digits uh some months last year to Triple digits most months this
38:34
year I'm can go to the next um some future initiatives um one
38:40
of them actually kind of came online as we were writing the report um our new axon body Waring cameras are out um
38:47
they're working fantastically the backend software is amazing it's it's really doing
38:52
everything we expected it to do and one of the great things is it just uploads quick it's like you don't even even really have to think about it so if
38:58
there's there's an issue somebody calls and says hey uh can you look into this um rather than fighting with a computer
39:04
all day to try to upload a video it's there when you want it um so that's been fantastic we will be deploying new
39:11
electronic control weapons with that um we're going to be purchasing three new hybrid Patrol vehicles um which have
39:17
actually already been obtained and we're just waiting to get them all outfitted with radios and lights um and we are in
39:24
the process of completing a major renovation to our gym and lock ER room the lockers came in today they look
39:29
great um that was a 30-year-old decrepit rusted bubbling floor uh situation down
39:37
there and it's really looking fantastic so while I'm here I will just have to give a shout out to Chris and Sue Tucker
39:42
and especially Mickey manay of the highway department we're all doing a fantastic job for that uh with us go to
39:49
the next slide so the next thing I did was I kind of hit on some of our statistics um one
39:54
of the things that's come up a lot is people want data from the police department um I have a lot of detailed
40:01
data and that's one thing I'm going to want to actually engage you guys on as kind of what you guys want to see in it
40:06
um so hitting some major topics uh I I noted you know what we did this year what we did last year our actual calls
40:11
for service are actually down a bit um our calls for alarms are down 15% domestic incidents which is a great
40:17
thing are down 4% our mental health calls for service are actually up 9% um I I wouldn't put like a value judgment
40:23
on that because that could just be that you know people are more willing to reach out to us because they know we
40:29
have a a behavioral health specialist so I don't I don't think I want to say uh uh oh that's a problem um traffic stops
40:36
are down um last year frankly to to a number that I don't really like um we're
40:42
actually pushing a lot harder because again that's another thing we we hear a lot from the public we need more traffic enforcement we need more traffic
40:48
enforcement right anybody who's been to a traffic safety committee meeting knows that one thing that everybody wants is more traffic enforcement so luckily this
40:56
year we're actually up 40 1% from last year uh where we were so we're looking really good on that this 2025 um our
41:03
auto accidents were down 1% so that's a little positive our case reports that we handled were down 10% and our res of
41:09
made were up 9% so I think it's a little more officer
41:15
proactivity uh reported violent offenses um they Rose very slightly from 2024 uh
41:22
in 2024 from 2023 most categories are fairly steady over time with the of
41:27
simple assault which started rising in 2020 and uh it remains higher than previous levels to the next
41:36
slide property offenses is the next slide that we have for you most property offenses remain steady over time as well
41:42
with the exception of vandalism in larsy um we actually observed a continued steady decrease in vandalism which we're
41:49
very happy about and then larsy Rose from 2021 to 2022 followed by a fairly
41:54
significant decline since so we're still working that are area but um it looks like hopefully we're on a trend
42:00
downwards you can go to the next slide aggravated assault cases and
42:05
arrests um so in the next few slides I'm going to kind of compare the number of cases we we took in to the number of
42:10
arrests we made um and in 2024 arrests accounted for 63% of total aggravated
42:16
assault cases um and one thing that should be noted right as you're looking at that chart in um I think it was 20 21
42:24
right you can actually have more individuals arrested you have cases because um you know one of the elements
42:30
of aggravated assault is that uh sometimes multiple people commit one assault and that makes ITA we can go to
42:36
the next slide our simple assault cases um reported simple assaults remain higher
42:43
than 2019 levels but lower than 2022 our arrest for simple assault also Rose
42:48
slightly from 2023 to 2024 and statistics for violent offenses such as robbery rate weapons law
42:54
violations are included in my report but um they trended this single digits so if you want to look into those you can but
43:00
statistically there's not a lot to kind of grab out of that we can go to the next
43:07
slide so burglary arrest and cases um burglar is one of the most common high-end property crimes that we see
43:13
here in Beacon even though it is still pretty low um there continues to be notable decline in the number of
43:19
reported burglaries with approximately 41% decrease When comparing 2019 to 2024 so feeling pretty good on the burglary
43:26
front as well can go to the next
43:31
slide um vandalism as I had mentioned destruction of property or vandalism is a property crime which can be a felony
43:37
or misdemeanor um based upon the value of the property that's destroyed there's been a 60% decrease in
43:44
reported cases from 2019 to 2024 um while the number of arrests have down slightly from 2023 to 2024 the number of
43:51
reported cases decreased by far more go to the next
43:57
larsy cases um reported larsy in uh incidents have been increasing from 2019 the upward Trend may have broken in
44:04
2023 from 2023 to 2024 we saw a decrease of approximately 26% while rest Rose
44:10
from 12 to 15 um just noting anecdotally it does seem increasingly common for victims to
44:17
decline to pursue charges even when we've identified a suspect um we've had a few package theft cases where we
44:23
worked it down we're ready to make an arrest and the victim says Ah I don't really want to do it you know we've gotten some Larsen from stores where all
44:30
right we've got the suspect and they say I don't want to press charges I just don't want them to come back so that causes a little bit of a disparity
44:36
between arrest and cases um when it comes to Larsen we can go to the next
44:43
slide use of force um while arrests have decreased from 2019 use of force has
44:48
remained rather steady likely because most instances don't stem from officer initiated arrests which have become more
44:53
infrequent but rather um from crimes involving a victim or Witness who called for help in 2024 use of force incidents
45:00
represented less than 10% of arrests and just 33% of total service
45:07
calls so going forward in initiative um in addition to our large initiatives that we outlined previously the
45:13
department will continue its mission to serve the community through our successful programs of community engagement and realistic focused
45:19
training we're going to seek to improve the output and precision of our traffic enforcement measures and as always we'll
45:25
work closely with community members and dri District's attorney's office to uh respond to criminal activity and build
45:31
cases which lead to successful interventions or criminal prosecutions were
45:36
appropriate do you guys have any questions I'd like thank you I'd like to
45:44
know what those two aliens did uh in the first slide to get arrested uh they went
45:50
up to officer Lawrence and asked for photo op and he was quite willing to oblig it made a made a good one lik on
45:57
Facebook for that uh yeah they asked me for the photo op to arrest them and I I refused but
46:03
but luckily there was someone willing to do it he came up to me and said us bold guys have to stick together
46:11
photograph um can you say a little bit about your bike Patrol plans for 2025 as
46:16
far as you know them at this point as the weather is starting to get warmer yeah so actually we just put out the notification short sleeves are
46:22
acceptable um and when the weather is appropriate officer Lawrence should if he's working and we have the Staffing um
46:28
meaning if the dispatcher didn't call in so we don't have to pull an officer off the road when he is working days he
46:33
should be out there on the bike um and I also just kind of put out a department wide uh survey to see if anybody was
46:39
actually interested in going to the school this year because I'd like to get more officers available for that when
46:44
you say going to the school do you mean going into the school or just being in oh I'm sorry the school to learn how to
46:49
be like oh I see great great yeah it's it's a fairly extensive School actually they have to ride up and downstairs and learn a lot of moves and stuff like that
46:55
so it's not we can't just tell you like hey this is a good bike and you're a good guy take this so so I'm
47:02
understanding we currently have one officer who's trained that's correct well we have more but they've moved up in rank to where they're not available
47:08
anymore they're in the detectives got it well I wanted to say I was happy to see
47:13
the bike uh relaunched uh the bikes on Main Street and even just the presence
47:19
of the police on Main Street I've noticed it more in the past like last year during the
47:24
summertime um I wanted to ask I also noticed in the the written report the
47:31
flock License Plate Reader that you got a couple those are the cameras outside
47:37
like at the city lines is that what those are or can you explain that okay so what they are is they're license
47:42
plate readers um they'll give a hit on a vehicle that's maybe suspect um in a
47:47
violent crime uh a stolen vehicle something along those lines um and we actually had one hit on that where we
47:53
actually made an arrest um in a violent domestic in New Jersey was able to get the person to custody yeah that was
48:00
great and how is the with the sign on bonus and the pay increases has you have
48:05
you seen any kind of traction or impact on that yet so we just did two interviews um on Thursday uh with NYPD
48:14
candidates they both have seven years on so they're they're making pretty good money in the city but we're we'll you know see if we can offer them a better
48:20
quality of life and see if we can get them across the Finish Line on that good good I think that's for the most I think
48:27
everything else was covered thank you yeah Beyond those two that you
48:32
already interviewed what's do you have a so sense of your other opportunities to potentially Recruit new officers this
48:37
year well the mass agility for the entire list um for the last Civil Service list is on the 26th of next
48:44
month so the 26th of April which is coming up very soon um once that happens we'll have a new list and then we'll
48:51
start going from there um I'm hoping to see some people on the beacon resident preferred list so I can kind of get a
48:56
crack at them before any other departments but you know we just don't know until we have it in the end great thank you yeah it would be nice if and I
49:02
know that you've been keeping us up to date so as you as we kind of pass the end of April and there's an opportunity
49:07
either directly or through Chris just to let us know how things are going I think that would be appreciated for
49:13
sure this is great I really appreciate all the statistics and great reporting in here um I noticed in the Staffing
49:19
section you talk about the need for Recruitment and Retention and we talked about this a couple times I think when
49:25
we're talking about recruitment in different reports but it'd be very interesting to me to hear or to see in
49:30
the reports going forward um it's all Financial it seems like retention strategies sign on bonuses um and and
49:38
the like but there are potentially other strategies to encourage retention you know staff culture and it'd be great to
49:44
hear about you know and even like feedback from the officers too towards that end yeah I just you know I think that there are other things that create
49:50
a culture of wanting to maintain what we've got the good things that are here so it'd be nice to see that included in
49:56
some maybe more qualitative if it's not quantitative but just some reporting on retention strategies I mean right now
50:02
you know we are looking into you know one of the things we also kind of lack for our officers is opportunities to
50:07
participate in kind of specialization um being a small Department it's hard to specialize you know you can't really
50:13
take a guy and say okay you're only going to do this um but we are looking for some opportunities you know going
50:18
forward it's sort of something we have to kind of discuss and make sure we have all the resources in line before we kind of publicly announce something so that's
50:25
why I'm a little hesitant to kind of bring up of those initiatives because if they fall through then it kind of can actually have a you know a degradation
50:30
on morale so you did put in for a a drone Grant though um putting in
50:37
today maybe everyone will be excited about the bike opportunity yeah I I'm hoping you know there are people that
50:44
you know a lot of officers really do like it um yeah officer Lawrence who who does it is really does enjoy being out
50:49
there so um you had asked a a question about what kind of data we would like to see I
50:56
think I think um one suggestion I have and you tell me about capacity here is
51:01
to see some of this data mapped along locations around the city um and also
51:07
time of day um I would say particularly traffic stops and calls
51:12
overall uh would be the two areas I would be most interested in seeing and you know this is to try and for me
51:19
understand how to sort of take into account anecdotal um you know uh
51:25
concerns I hear from folks about certain neighborhoods um perhaps um and yeah
51:32
have some data uh to contextualize that yeah so one kind of issue right time of day is pretty easy um one issue with
51:39
location is sort of creating how how are we going to Define it right um right by
51:46
Street by neighborhood how do how do we kind of Define what that looks like um usually what what will happen is um you
51:52
know we'll have a complaint in an area hey uh we have this big problem how many calls have we gotten there and
51:58
then we can kind of narrow it down to to like what we received how to respond but
52:03
like kind of putting it into a context of like we have this many calls here that many calls there that many calls there is kind of a little difficult and
52:10
I mean if if people have ideas I'm certainly interested to kind of hear them if there's like a hey we want to map it this way we want to map it that
52:16
way yeah and I am not a data nerd but I know there are many data nerds uh at this table and also in the city so I'm
52:22
guessing by hoping by saying that out loud someone will come up with a suggestion
52:29
sure will this uh report be available online for the public to look at yeah it
52:35
is right now okay great yeah well I think it's a it's a um a real
52:40
Improvement in terms of communicate communicating to the public as well as the council as to really what's going on
52:46
what's happening and I'm really glad we're doing this on a regular basis app thank you yeah I appreciate um how thorough
52:53
this report is and and your last one as well
52:58
um sort of relayed to what Paloma asking I know that you mentioned the report I couldn't find at the moment that having
53:04
access to the New York State Department of Transportation data that helps with targeted traffic enforcement can you say
53:11
a little bit more about that sure um in my last report I had mentioned that we were kind of
53:17
trying going to try to look into um trying to align our traffic enforcement efforts not only with public complaints
53:24
but also with auto accidents um because that's really good practice to try to address traffic concerns that might be
53:30
leading to accidents um we're trying to figure out a way to kind of do that and then sort of by accident I discovered
53:36
and they don't really advertise it to the police it's more for studies um that dot actually takes all of our traffic
53:43
data uh and puts it on a map um and there's actually a link to every one of our traffic accidents on this thing but
53:49
you actually have to apply for access to it it's not just like open to the public um I did get that it's been a little
53:55
difficult to kind of process I will say one thing that really stands out is that um as far as auto accident data uh
54:02
everything pales in comparison to Main Street so that's that's one thing that I took away you know instantly is that the
54:07
the great majority uh of our auto accidents do occur on Main
54:19
Street can I ask you guys one question sure so um for some of the things
54:25
because I track them month for my monthly reports I gave monthly statistics right calls for mental health
54:30
calls for alarm such and such like that um and then going through it I was like does this kind of gum up the works is it
54:36
is it better for you guys to have like a yearly comparison to like what we put on the slide or do you like the month to
54:43
month data like I'm just wondering if you guys would find it easier if I just gave the totals for the year or or what
54:49
thoughts are on that so I you know let one of the Geeks speak um I saw the monthly data it wasn't as interesting
54:56
right because in order to say what patterns you have to compare you know summer to Prior summer didn't think so I
55:02
think the annual data is just fine yeah um the other geeky thing is I'm trying to think what your data set look like it
55:08
would be I know your data set for um events or whatever you call them um
55:14
calls would be a time and a you know an issue which is easy to do you'd have to
55:20
get location to do locations and that might be hard um but think about it right it really depends depends on what
55:26
you're recording and I assume you're putting in the computer and then you can get the data um but it it you know might
55:32
be harder right we we record it by I mean we report it card it by house number if that's relevant um or by the
55:39
street um so that does kind of make it a little difficult to say you know because some streets stretch multiple areas of
55:45
Beacon so it does make it a little more uh tedious to kind of yeah and you also want the data to be unidentifiable
55:53
right okay so next year we'll just year overall I would think so I kind of
55:58
thought that too but I did it in the last report I didn't want to take it out without kind of talk I mean like look at your use of force we're talking about
56:04
two a month on average I mean come on that's not going to tell you much to look at it by month
56:10
so yeah if you if you and look I'm assume you are looking at the monthly rate because you're managing a month if
56:16
there are any interesting Trends by a Seasons that are useful to share with us then maybe call those out but I would
56:21
agree I don't need to see every month I appreciate that feedback because I the
56:26
same thing especially when I added a third year to it I'm like next year this is going to get
56:32
messy oh but it's great to be able to see it kind of compare over the years and particularly the farther away we get
56:37
from covid which was for many reasons easy to see as an exceptional year meaning outside of the norm now we have
56:44
years kind of the trends and and what's actually the reality of of where we are
56:51
right okay if I could I just want to take the opportunity to say Tom is only
56:56
been in this position now for 10 months he started in June last year and he's been doing a an amazing job at
57:03
rebuilding the morale of the department he had a hand in the locker room as well
57:08
and he's been managing our our staffing crisis um as well as he can and I just
57:14
want to thank you for everything you've been doing appreciate that and and the recent solving of the murders just as a
57:20
testament to the the hard work of our department yeah and that's something you know what while while I'm here I'll
57:26
highlight that right that spanned multiple people um we have retired members who work very hard on that who
57:31
are being called back to testify um all the way into current detectives so it's something that really um those guys and
57:38
women worked really hard on um and and we're pretty proud of the work that they did on that even though it took well not
57:44
even though it took a long time it took a long time um and and that's part of what we're proud
57:50
of thank you thank you guys thank you thank you
57:57
um okay uh the next set of things will involve Mark Price we're going to talk
58:03
about several items uh at uh Park projects right you going to do that
58:08
Chris going to do that you're going to do that okay thank you Mark the um thank you good evening
58:15
everyone um so I think I'm here tonight because we have a couple of contracts that are going to come uh in front of
58:20
you guys probably to look at today and um and next week to approve um and just
58:26
just it seems like a perfect time to give a little update on on on what's going on uh in the Parks and and mostly
58:31
with capital projects so those two contracts to to be reviewed are for two
58:36
components of the South Avenue Park Rehab um the court surfacing and fencing um those were the winning bids and and
58:43
the contracts we want to award for that work um that's part of I believe five
58:48
components if I was to to count the court lighting um we're going to replace Court lighting resurface both courts
58:54
replace all the fencing on both courts um there's another one um another bid
58:59
that's due uh this coming week it should have been back last week but we needed to make make a last minute revision so
59:06
we left it out for another week um just so um we could get some competitive bids on that that'll be a awarded an in this
59:13
week and then we'll be basically set for the full project which um the the bid
59:18
that's still out is for all the site work which includes the the prep work for the new restroom um that's on order
59:24
so new restroom ton of site work to make um some of those failing retaining walls
59:29
go away the tie into for the bathroom and then basically brand new courts in that Park so that's just an overview um
59:35
on the screen of the the park currently um but essentially we're we're going to be reworking that whole South Avenue um
59:42
side of the park and and um um be done by early summer so it it should look um
59:49
quite nice um and the inclusion of a bathroom is is kind of a big big plus for the park so um it'll look very much
59:56
like the other parks and and amenities and and um and sort of updates the uh restroom itself will
1:00:04
include a a matching mural um to the other two parks um which I've already spoken to the artist and once the
1:00:11
project dust settles we can figure out when we're going to do that but we'll do that probably late in the summer early
1:00:17
fall with a similar um Community participation of the painting of it so that that's sort of the the cherry on
1:00:24
top for the the whole project which um should be completed by um mid to late summer
1:00:29
completely the um so that's those two contracts while I was here I was going to speak to the other um sort of you
1:00:38
know mediumsized project which is going to be a rehabbing of the skate park this spring um it's actually supposed to
1:00:43
start in a couple weeks April 11th uh we have a contractor coming in to do a full repaving of of that Park um which will
1:00:51
then set up um installation of some new um skate park features and fixtures I think they're to be delivered sometime
1:00:57
in June um and um we are including in that rehab a one of the approved um
1:01:06
participation and government um projects will be a component of the skate park um the art wall that was proposed we're
1:01:13
we're implementing over there so we'll be installing some some concrete fixtures and and building some panels to
1:01:20
include probably about a 48t long 6ft tall art wall that can be used by the
1:01:25
public um um so that will really you know sort of transform that corner as well um and that hopefully will be done
1:01:31
like I said fixtures are coming in June so probably mid June so going to be a busy spring um between those two
1:01:36
projects um and um it's kind of the update I have for now well and the
1:01:42
backdrop for why Mark is here tonight is we had four four bids out one is for
1:01:49
restroom cleaning um and you may remember in 2021 we started cleaning the
1:01:56
bathrooms and reopen them um which has been very successful that three-year
1:02:01
contract we were under has expired so we needed to go back out to bid so we will be bringing you a contract for Frank's
1:02:08
professional maintenance for a three-year um cost of approximately
1:02:14
55 you have it in your memo it's I think it's 55,000 um
1:02:20
525 great 5254 five it's 17,500 a year
1:02:25
that's for cleaning bathrooms also doing The Visitor Center which we reopened doing some cleaning at the settlement
1:02:31
Camp um this is a good news story for us because it's a local company and they
1:02:36
were also the low bidder had good references and were ready to move forward um on South Avenue Park that
1:02:43
project goes all the way back to 2020 and 2021 Capital programs um the council
1:02:50
at that time wanted to establish the first public restroom that wasn't just a porta poot there
1:02:56
um so Mark has ordered a beautiful manufactured um restroom that will be
1:03:01
installed probably later this summer um the site work that he talked about is
1:03:07
being bid to prepare the area for that and to redo um some of the collapsing
1:03:13
retaining walls along the tennis court and the basketball court in addition we're going to be changing all of the
1:03:19
fence mesh on both courts and resurfacing both of them so we have two
1:03:25
of those three bids the court surfacing and Court fencing came back last week they are both just a little below our
1:03:32
engineer estimate and budget which is great news our site work um bids will be
1:03:37
coming back on Thursday so we don't have that name for you yet but we'll be filling it in and we want to approve
1:03:43
those at the next meeting so that we can schedule the work and get it done before basketball season starts um so you're
1:03:50
going to see you know again project one isn't on here because we um that's lighting that we did through um a
1:03:57
Cooperative agreement with um sourcewell yeah
1:04:02
sourcewell um that uh our attorneys worked with us on and then you'll be approving projects two three and four
1:04:09
and the restroom has already been ordered and will be arriving um once the
1:04:15
site work has been done so we hope to reopen the the facility and and give it a a much needed facelift uh this summer
1:04:24
and we'll have we'll have news of about park closing or um um amenities not being usable once we have a better
1:04:30
timeline established and have all our contracts back and stuff so once we sit down with the contractors we'll have an
1:04:36
idea of their detailed schedule we'll also be having an event where we do a groundbreaking for the council so we and
1:04:43
and some of this was funded by assembly member Jonathan Jacobson so we'll be inviting him to join us as
1:04:51
well um even if we didn't invite him he would be there yeah as we well know and
1:04:56
are always grateful um so just to make sure Council um move forward with these
1:05:02
and okay to bring the fourth one when we get the bids directly to the meeting so you'll have a a memo like the ones that
1:05:08
are in your packet for the one that doesn't have it currently and if you have an issue obviously we can defer it at that meeting but I don't think there
1:05:15
should be right yeah I have no problem with that I did have a few small questions okay but I'm yeah happy with
1:05:22
the overall plan um in terms of the uh bathroom cleaning um I assume you
1:05:29
know knowing this is a three-year contract that the new bathroom will is included in all of this um great yeah
1:05:36
yes um and I had made a suggestion a while back for um additional signage on
1:05:43
the bathrooms to indicate hours that it's open um and and potentially even for the visitor center to indicate that
1:05:49
there there is a bathroom in the visitor center I just wondering if um that idea
1:05:55
had been picked up at all or if there is an update sure yeah I mean uh the sign
1:06:00
is just yet to be ordered for the new one but um you know that's definitely a a note that it's open seven days Dawn to
1:06:07
DUS or is good that the hours vary slightly but I think at at the very least if we have some signs that makes
1:06:13
reference to the um restrooms being open same same time as the parks essentially that that's helpful for folks yeah I
1:06:19
think so I think i' I've noted that I just seem to happen to always be there when they're not open um and I think
1:06:25
just you know having that enforced for the public I'm sure I'm not the only one about when when they are open would be
1:06:31
useful um and um I think my other oh my other question
1:06:38
was just um if you could remind me where on the site at South Avenue the
1:06:44
bathroom's going to be I thought I saw it on the map but I wasn't sure uh closest the basketball court so if
1:06:50
you're familiar with the park there's a electrical panel that sits there um so if between the the parking lot and the
1:06:58
court oh okay okay great where the porta potty is and then we part of having the building there is we can incorporate
1:07:05
that electrical infrastructure into the building so it's no longer just
1:07:10
out and and uh re retooling the fencing so essentially coming up the parking
1:07:16
area ada8 compliant to the restroom and then level with the court so we're going to redo the uh Court entrances to the
1:07:24
bathroom side we'll have access to the other side like it is traditionally but it'll kind of turn the cour courts
1:07:30
around so it makes a little more sense to the the parking area versus the corner of the park there that's great
1:07:36
and will it have a water bottle Filling Station it has a water bottle and water ping station
1:07:44
yes uh can you remind me how trash cans work at that Park are they under Royal
1:07:50
cing or they ones that are maintained city the city maintains them is there any
1:07:55
thought is that going to they'll be taken out if they need to be taken out and then put back kind of roughly where they are is there also any changes
1:08:02
you're considering around those I just curious as we think about use we're
1:08:08
we're replacing most of those um so the the old barrels that we have are old juice barrels that we get from I think
1:08:15
an apple juice company so we're ordering a whole new round of them because they've gotten dented and rusted um and
1:08:22
they're just interspersed around the park you'll see them on every part of that Park um and our guys actually just
1:08:29
drive through and and dump them each week so it shouldn't interfere with our
1:08:35
picking that up we we are going to have to close the parking lot part of the parking lot for when the crane comes in
1:08:42
to put in place the
1:08:47
restroom question for you on the on the options here it's amazing the differences in some of these bids that
1:08:54
you see three four times differences so it makes you wonder is it Apples to Apples I mean is it you know the
1:09:00
surfacing is it the same the you know the fencing companies or any differences that are worth noting in terms of
1:09:05
materials utilized duration warranty Etc that goes into accepting not necessarily
1:09:12
the lowest bid any other reason to consider a higher bid you should yeah so when it when it comes to these types of
1:09:18
Public Works projects the city is obligated under state law to award it to the lowest responsible bidder and so
1:09:24
usually when the bids come in and they see there's a big difference those biders get contacted make sure that they
1:09:30
understood that they didn't make any errors in their bid they uh vet their qualifications and references to make
1:09:36
sure that they've done similar work before and they have those generally there's U usually either a number of
1:09:42
projects that they've done similar they're required to list those in the bid responses um and so there there is a
1:09:48
vetting process to make sure that they are capable have experience with it understand the parameters of the project
1:09:55
and that there's not going to be hopefully any issues and won and Samson are
1:10:01
Consultants on on the two in front of you did diligence last week and contacted references and and referencing
1:10:08
contracts I had some questions related to the surfacing and they they took a couple steps further to confirm that the
1:10:14
low bidder had qualifications and and and you know had given us a memo and
1:10:19
that their in their confidence both both were you know capable and and of the
1:10:25
work into meeting I guess a bare minimum required in the request for proposals but it still begs the question if
1:10:30
there's some Superior strategy product that could be utilized it's not necessarily reflected in this vetting
1:10:37
process it would state law yeah the city would need to it would create liability
1:10:43
to not go with the lowest responsible bidder as long as they need to qualifications and you know vetted it
1:10:49
out so it's yeah so it's a matter of the the requirements it's a matter of meeting the requirements it's a matter
1:10:54
of what requirements we set yeah and for example with these kids they had to have experience in similar types of jobs they
1:11:01
needed to show that they would be able to have sufficient Workforce to get the job done um and so there there are some
1:11:08
of those and that is a valid concern the city is however restrained by
1:11:13
competitive bidding requirements yeah so it puts the requirement on the city to do the work to know what it wants if it
1:11:19
wants something better if it's but yeah know well there's a specification in the
1:11:24
bid so they they're bidding to the product and the item amount that we've
1:11:30
put in and and there are guard rails after we start the project firstly they have to put a performance bond so we
1:11:37
actually have pulled companies performance bonds when they haven't done a good job um and you'll remember that
1:11:43
with the staircase out here that got rebuilt multiple times well that ended up not costing us any more um and we got
1:11:50
a a very good product at the end also the engineer has to review all the shop drawings and submitt to make sure that
1:11:57
whatever they're proposing is what was in the bid or it's equivalent or better
1:12:02
and then we do inspections as well so when there's concrete installed there's testing of the concrete to make sure it
1:12:08
meets the PSI standards that are required um if there's asphalt it has to be done in a certain Manner and we test
1:12:15
that um so again I think there there you you never know what you're
1:12:20
going to get low bid is probably not the best way to do this I would love to have local companes have a greater preference
1:12:27
or when we do these bids um but but we do have some some things to to make sure
1:12:34
it doesn't go sideways and and often times they're also required to do what's called a maintenance Bond so they're
1:12:40
required to you know either put up a bond or warranty the work that they do so if it ends up falling apart or having
1:12:46
materials issue in a year the city would have that to rely on to remedy it you
1:12:52
give a good example though Chris like talking about a concrete product um if we if the city wanted for example there
1:12:58
are now lower carbon intensity car concretes that are out there and if we wanted to specify that we would have to
1:13:04
do the work feel confident in it and have that be the requirement that biders would have to meet we're not an open
1:13:10
based minimum requirement is not going to have biders be able to compete if they're bidding for more expensive potentially environmentally Superior
1:13:17
product and am I correct in understanding that something like that would go in our procurement policy or is
1:13:22
something is what we're discussing separate from that it it's largely separate it's most on
1:13:28
the the specifications of the product I mean there are industry standards and
1:13:33
state requirements for concrete and certain products like that to make sure that they can support loads and so when
1:13:40
they go out to test that concrete or those products they make sure that they meet you know generally manufacturer
1:13:46
specifications specifications in the drawings as well as a you know minimum safety requirements as well and and
1:13:53
Supply is an issue too you have to make sure you can get that in this area um
1:13:58
and again a lot of the projects like the stuff we're doing on Fishkill and Teller Avenue do has
1:14:05
very um detailed specifications on every product that we use um so I don't know
1:14:12
that we're even allowed to use that this has very minimal concrete um it's just it's a broader issue re I'm raising it
1:14:18
just for the procurement insites that it that it does speak to it it does put the homework on the city you know the burden is on the city to to do the additional
1:14:24
work if there's something Superior that meets requirements and and I think you need to have an engineer who's willing to say that product has the performance
1:14:31
standards that we would want I mean you don't want products that aren't going to have the life of course use life that's
1:14:38
that's right but that's part of the homework I wanted to um I had that same
1:14:44
question Jee because I was just amazed at the difference in the the bids throughout these uh quotes um wanted to
1:14:51
ask just with the skate park since that is coming up is that noticed already that that's I'm assuming the skate
1:14:58
Park's going to be closed when they're resurfacing that yeah well it sort of um
1:15:03
in in a a way there will be a small period where it's closed for the repaving uh we're going to use some of
1:15:09
the smaller fixturing in the inter term until the the newer stuff comes um it'll
1:15:14
still be open and usable then it'll just be in its you know smaller form for okay the months until June and then probably
1:15:20
a day or two when uh our new fixturing our larger fixturing comes and is installed so it won't be as as
1:15:27
interrupted as as the work at South Avenue but a couple of days in April and a couple of days because I just the kids
1:15:33
are off from school yeah last day 11th and not back until after Easter so that following that week the April 11th you
1:15:40
mentioned they're off so just to keep that we should be able to get everything in back back and usable you know that
1:15:47
we're keeping in the park in the day or two once the pavement set up up and then one other
1:15:53
question is there going to be lined pickle balls separate for the on the tennis are they going to be with the
1:15:59
tennis the uh plan for South Avenue's new pickle ball um lineups will be uh I
1:16:05
believe we have room for four we're going to be using the tennis Nets as the barrier between two and I'm going to
1:16:12
order um rolling Nets so essentially a bit of an upgrade and that we'll be
1:16:18
using standard pickle ball nets and and doubling our pickle ball space thank you
1:16:23
my pickle ball friends will be happy
1:16:29
that's all I had all right folks cool thank you thank you these are
1:16:36
all exciting projects thank you yeah um so just remember this has been a
1:16:42
lot of work for Mark and I just want to say he's doing a great job yeah thank you Mark um a lot of this is capital
1:16:48
investment so not in our operating budget um but significant investments in our parks there are operating items
1:16:54
there also approving right the the cleaning which is a big step up for us um so I'm think these are all good
1:17:01
things to do but I'm also mindful when the next budget comes so I'm just telling you up front um okay so next one
1:17:09
is an appointment of Nick Kowski that's the position of a program assistant Chris you'll tell us about what program
1:17:17
I think we should talk about Dar Sims sorry let's back up you're going to tell us about the appointment of Dar Sims as
1:17:24
temporary fire Lieutenant sorry well I'd love to um so we have four lieutenants
1:17:29
in our fire department and one of the lieutenants is on um leave with an
1:17:35
injury and we don't know that they're going to be back for a while um in the interim we would like to put someone in
1:17:42
the lieutenant position so that um there's another person who can take
1:17:47
those shifts and we're not just paying overtime for the three lieutenants Who Remain um the chief interviewed the
1:17:53
three people who are on the Civil Service list for lieutenants and dar Sims was the highest scoring he's been
1:18:01
um a f in fire in Ems for 15 years and previously worked at Castle uh point
1:18:08
until I think five years ago he's been with us I think for five years and um
1:18:14
has done extensive training in fact he's an instructor um from for many of the fire uh service items and um we would
1:18:23
like to make him a temporary lieutenant and when the other Lieutenant eventually
1:18:28
retires uh we think he would also be a great permanent uh Lieutenant but for now we'd make him temporary um and we'd
1:18:36
like to bring that to you Monday he and he's already been serving informally in that capacity he really is well
1:18:42
respected by the department and very effective so um you have his resume and
1:18:48
also a memo from uh fire chief lucasi in your packets
1:18:57
has a great sense of humor I believe you he does so he was with the beacon fire
1:19:05
department and then he had left and he's coming back no previously he was with Castle point I'm sorry and then he came
1:19:12
to Beacon fire he's been with us um since
1:19:18
2020 and um I'm reading his resume that's it's so his resume has a typo on
1:19:24
it he it the um the castle point was the one that he did from 2012 to 2020 and
1:19:31
then he came here in 2020 and he's been he's been a firefighter with us I'm like
1:19:36
this so he's he confused all of us I this Castle Point fire department he's been here yes okay since 2020 and he's
1:19:45
also a uh Marine combat veteran so he's he's he's got a lot of really strong
1:19:52
skills and we're really excited as well I saw which is great too and he does he
1:19:57
does a lot of training on his own he just seems uh kind of voracious on on
1:20:03
learning new skills and that really has set him apart from the other two candidates are great but he was really
1:20:11
strong now that I understand the timeline he needs to fix his resume yeah
1:20:17
no sorry about that I only quote that at about 5:30 and then I had to figure out what it
1:20:23
meant all right okay and then you tell us about Nick now yeah Nick Kowski um
1:20:29
we're proposing for an a appointment to Municipal program assistant which is an
1:20:35
entry-level position we've created with civil service that supports our HR
1:20:40
director and also helps with our finance department uh Nick worked with us part-time while I was going to college
1:20:47
he graduated with a a degree in um cyber
1:20:52
security and then he decided he he had been around HR enough that he wanted to
1:20:58
do human resources um so we are proposing to make him uh permanent and
1:21:04
he will be continuing the great work he's done on digitizing a lot of the
1:21:09
records that we have one of the issues with our records management is is things are very difficult to find and we use a
1:21:16
lot of space downstairs and he's been going through with various departments and figuring out what can be digitized
1:21:22
and then disposed of um so and he has been a great support to
1:21:28
uh Sarah Morris our HR Director I noticed he's provisional is
1:21:33
that to do with civil service and time yeah you're you're provisional for the first six or nine months um and Sarah's
1:21:40
going to slap me for not knowing that but it's one of those um and then you become permanent there's like a
1:21:46
probationary period yeah but I mean the nice thing about Nick is he's been with
1:21:52
us for three years and we know him and we can rely on him and he's smart and um
1:21:58
I think he's a great fit is this role part-time or full-time this is a full-time position and sorry if I missed this this
1:22:05
is a new position no it was funded through his temporary position and then
1:22:10
we just um we there there's enough in the budget to cover the fulltime this is an
1:22:17
entrylevel position that doesn't pay a lot so I think we had put in for a halftime person but at a rate that that
1:22:24
was higher than what he's making so we can get him for full-time for what we
1:22:29
put in the part-time HR but prior to him being here in the
1:22:35
program the other program for 3 years this was not an existing position no it was a part no because we
1:22:43
just created the HR Director in 2022 that was only a part-time position
1:22:50
got it I guess I'm I'm really what I'm asking is is you know creating uh this full-time position even though
1:22:57
it's from what has been a part-time position for a long time increasing um
1:23:02
the capacity of the HR department okay yes but it's it's it's within the budget that we allocated for
1:23:09
this year right okay and it does it helps um for
1:23:15
instance there are are letters that we have to get out to retirees there are healthc care um notifications that we
1:23:22
have to get out and and he can handle those for Sarah so that she can deal with um other other employee issues yeah
1:23:29
that's great thank you well even the digitizing that would be great to get it organized electronically it we didn't
1:23:36
even know what we had in the back um so it's not just about like making space
1:23:42
it's about having access to records so we can find them
1:23:47
I the building department as well um eventually yeah because we're digitizing in that department so he's he's
1:23:54
downstairs he can help Finance building but primarily he's
1:24:00
HR yeah great I'm glad to both keep him on he's been great so far and to find a
1:24:05
role that also kind of in and continues to kind of have him lean into the areas where we have a need as well so it's a
1:24:11
great fit all around thanks okay uh next one's a planning
1:24:17
board appointment so James from Mulan actually applied a couple years ago I uh talked to him about joining at that time
1:24:24
and he had a wasn't quite ready yet he had some work rated um you know demands
1:24:30
and family demands um he said he's interested now uh Jim is uh in the
1:24:36
lighting business so it's not directly uh I wouldn't call him a planning professional or related but it's sort of
1:24:43
like you know tangentially related because he does architectural lighting he does theater lighting so I would call
1:24:48
him more of a lay appointment as opposed to professional appointment otherwise you know it came right off the group
1:24:54
that was applying for planning board and I'm pych that he's willing to do it now and has the
1:24:59
time so I just move him forward and you know you're all good Liss on rout around
1:25:05
the corner from you I can vouch for him I know him and he's a great guy and I think he'll be a great asset to the planning board yeah good yeah I was just
1:25:12
curious there any other things that he's done in in Beacon that that he's going to involv with that you know Le or
1:25:17
George I just I don't think so I mean he's done a lot of Sound and Lighting for various um events and so on but um I
1:25:23
think it seems like he's probably not working as much you know outside the city so I think he has more time and I
1:25:30
think his kids are getting older too so he's got more time on his hands yeah I think you've described it right yeah
1:25:35
great thank you and I was joking with him earlier that he lives next door to the chair of the planning board so probably there some might be some undue
1:25:41
pressure that we should try to spare him from so I don't know if that has anything to do with it but that's a correct disclosure uh is it like to the
1:25:48
right I think it's to the right because uh to the left was uh is uh yeah anyway
1:25:55
um that's what I understand as well um okay is he behind you is it like
1:26:01
directly pretty much yes well you got two problems right two conflicts anyway
1:26:07
uh last one is a draft resolution for us urging the Senate and the assembly to
1:26:12
pass a packaging reduction bill this is actually uh a revision a bringing up
1:26:19
again of something that was on last year that we actually supported and Christian we tell us a little bit more about it
1:26:25
yeah thank you mayor so yes this is basically a uh second version of the state law that went through and did not
1:26:33
pass I believe it just kind of timed out last year there's been some minor revisions to the one that the council reviewed and supported um for example
1:26:41
there's actually more toxic chemicals that would be eventually phased out of packaging um it would all however I
1:26:48
think kind of in a give the state legislature wants maybe this to pass um instead of reducing 50% of Packaging
1:26:54
within 12 years it would now be 30% um it would create an advisory Council a lot of the things from the previous
1:27:00
version are still similar uh there would be fees uh for producers as well as incentives for those producers to reduce
1:27:07
their packaging quantity um and also uh producer fees would could be used to
1:27:13
assist public and private uh collection systems it's a very similar one that the council reviewed last year just some
1:27:20
minor updates to it okay I'm still happy to support this
1:27:26
yeah I think it's fine all right cool um that's it um and we survived the warmth
1:27:34
in the building so um next meeting is next Monday it will be a formal meeting
1:27:40
again in two days at 7 here um and then for the next Workshop we will bring the
1:27:45
um adus and the Route 52 items forward uh I know that was a hold because we
1:27:51
just didn't have um the City attorney not Christian we have him but we didn't
1:27:56
have Nick who's been working on that issue and we also didn't have Natalie who I think is still in Hawaii um can I
1:28:02
ask a clarifying question about that Lee um if we as council members have
1:28:08
particular questions about options for the items that have been discussed that we're going to discuss with the planner
1:28:14
and uh and with natal so with Natalie and with with Nick can we is it okay
1:28:19
maybe question Christian for us to email like not to have a discussion over email but just send those questions in advance
1:28:25
so that the experts kind of have those to be able to kind of share thoughts I'd
1:28:30
appreciate you waiting till after this week so Nick can have a vacation he
1:28:35
really trying yeah I'm really trying to force him to take his vacation time and not call us every two hours I appreciate
1:28:43
um but he he does we we've been telling the department staff too to leave him alone but next after we yeah after this
1:28:50
next week we can do that yeah just looking to try to have something rather than sometimes we ask questions and they then have to come back in two weeks so
1:28:57
if there if we already know of things well yeah you you and I have chatted there might be several options to to go
1:29:02
about you know how do you transition or how do you phase something in on some of the areas that we're talking about so I
1:29:08
think that's worthwhile yeah um he was doing emails today because we had a
1:29:13
Court ruling and I was like go away will you um anyway um okay that's all I got
1:29:19
and I'll take a motion to adjourn motion to adjourn second and our next meeting
1:29:25
is I did that next Monday at 7 Monday at 7
