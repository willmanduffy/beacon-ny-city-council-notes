- Key areas covered: Community participation (31 events, bike patrol relaunch), staffing challenges and recruitment efforts, notable incidents (arrests for vandalism, weapon possession, assault, arson, hate crimes, 2022 murder case progress), Drug Task Force participation and impact on overdose rates, Mental Health America partnership statistics (184 calls, 130 follow-ups), training compliance, parking enforcement improvements (new equipment leading to increased ticketing), and future initiatives (new body cameras deployed, new Tasers, 3 hybrid patrol vehicles, gym/locker room renovation nearing completion).
- Statistics Overview (2024 vs 2023): Calls for service down slightly, alarms down 15%, domestic incidents down 4%, mental health calls up 9%, traffic stops down (but up 41% in early 2025 vs early 2024), auto accidents down 1%, case reports down 10%, arrests up 9%. Violent crime slightly up (driven by simple assault trend since 2020), property crime steady or decreasing (vandalism down 60% since 2019, larceny down 26% from 2023 peak). Use of force steady, involved in <10% of arrests.

### Concerns Raised (by Council)
- Need for more granular data presentation (annual vs. monthly trends, location/time mapping for calls/stops).
- Bike patrol plans for 2025.
- Effectiveness of recruitment incentives (sign-on bonus, pay increases).
- Need for non-financial retention strategies (staff culture, specialization opportunities).
- Inquiry about the purpose and function of the Flock license plate reader system mentioned in the written report.

### Responses/Solutions (from Chief Figlia)
- Open to refining data reporting (likely shifting to annual comparisons, will consider location mapping challenges).
- Bike patrol will operate when weather and staffing permit; seeking more officers to be trained.
- Recruitment: Interviewed two experienced NYPD officers; awaiting new civil service list after April 26th agility test.
- Retention: Exploring specialization opportunities (e.g., drone program grant application) but cautious about announcing premature initiatives.
- Flock cameras: Provided data on hits leading to arrests (e.g., NJ domestic violence suspect).
- Explained that Flock cameras read license plates at city entry points, alerting police to vehicles linked to crimes (e.g., stolen, involved in violent incidents), and cited a successful arrest resulting from an alert.

### Next Steps
- Continue recruitment efforts and monitor results from new civil service list.
- Refine future annual reports based on council feedback regarding data presentation.
- Implement planned initiatives (vehicles, Tasers).
- Council requested updates on staffing post-April agility test.
