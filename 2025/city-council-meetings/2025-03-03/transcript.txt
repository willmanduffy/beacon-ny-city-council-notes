pleased to present this evening uh Beacon's state of the city to the city council to our audience listening
2:34
tonight and to all our residents I'd like us to use this opportunity to highlight our achievements in the past
2:41
year and to outline our goals for the coming one in a word the state of the
2:46
city remains excellent um we're extremely fortunate uh with 2004
2:51
bringing a new Central fire station and major Investments while maintaining our solid financial position what makes this
2:58
so amazing um for those who've been here long enough is how far our city has come in the last 30 years or so transforming
3:05
from a tired Factory City to a reimagined one with a reinvigorated historic Main Street and a quality of
3:11
life that attracts newcomers investment and visitors uh a beacon and a model for
3:17
other communities to follow as I enter my six years mayor let me Begin by thanking the community for placing its
3:23
confidence in me and those on the council here with me I look forward to working with the entire Council to
3:29
continue building upon last year's successes and the Decades of efforts of
3:34
Prior Mayors and councils as I have said at prior state of the city presentations My overall commitments to you as mayor
3:41
of the our city include the following if you'd scroll
3:52
Mercedes oh she's got it got it oh back up one sorry
3:59
yeah if you'd back up one Mercedes uh but what I said I would be talking about is that list there it's
4:05
the same list as other years so it's Financial discipline which is about minimizing property tax increases which
4:12
we have done by prioritizing and timing City expenses and finding additional
4:17
non-property tax revenue sources Public Safety you know modernizing our
4:22
firefighting infrastructure attracting and retaining our highquality police and fire staff and improving EMS C coverage
4:30
infrastructure investment continuing the ongoing modernization of our roads sidewalks water supply and wastewater
4:37
treatment facilities enhanced quality of life investing in our Parks our Recreation
4:43
programs and other efforts that improve our day-to-day quality of life climate leadership staying ahead of the curve on
4:50
making our community an environmentally sustainable one and then also good government running a professional
4:56
effective and open government which is a local Municipal employer of choice thereby attracting and retaining good
5:03
employees I will review our accomplishments in each of these areas in 20124 and our plans for
5:10
2025 if we could go to the next slide so I start with the financials uh I know
5:16
that some people you know don't think that that's where things matter it's actually where um um I and the city
5:23
administrator and our finance director spent a lot of time our two cents is that um if you get this right everything
5:30
else comes from this and so I start here I know it has numbers I'll try to help you through them um Beacon's financial
5:37
help Mercedes could you advance the slide can you advance the slide thank you so Beacon's Financial
5:45
Health Remains the best it has been in decades we have undertaken some $40 million in capital projects including
5:51
investments in our fire station roads and sidewalks water sewer and wastewater treatment parks and quality of life plus
5:58
investments in our people people while keeping property tax increases below inflation and the state tax cap this
6:05
feedus required fiscal discipline and prioritization encouraging new private construction that increases our tax base
6:12
and finding non-property tax sources of revenue the 2025 budget that the mayor
6:18
proposed and the council passed is $36 million combined operating budget for
6:24
2025 that's the general fund and the water and sewer funds which continued our TR of lowering tax rates and keeping
6:31
overall tax increases below the state tax cap the lower tax rate that's the
6:37
chart on the top left so that tax rate is the Homestead meaning the rate on our
6:43
residential class because there's two classes the non-residential class has a higher rate that's not shown this is the
6:49
homestead tax rate which is what's charged per ,000 of assess value and so
6:57
it's um the way you read that is the current period 2025 is
7:03
$5.70 per $1,000 of assess value so for $100,000 of assess value that's
7:12
$570 right for $500,000 of assess value it's five times that 570,000 so just to
7:19
give you a sense of it where it was 10 years ago was closer to $9 per um, of
7:26
assessed value so it's been coming down every single year it's the lowest since 2009 and for comparison the tax rate is
7:34
over $10 for the cities of pipy and Newberg we expect to continue lowering
7:40
the city's tax rate with new construction and increases in the value of existing properties to make sure that
7:46
residents are not overburdened right so part of the problem part of the solution is working
7:52
this number down now this there's not magic here the question is how does it work right so the overall tax increase
7:59
means meaning not the rate but the total dollars that are collected from property
8:04
tax revenue which this year was around $13 million the 2025 total Levy is 13.2
8:11
million was a 3.8% increase from the last year which is well below inflation
8:17
and the state cap for comparison the cities of pipy and Kingston enacted 9%
8:23
increases we did a 3.8 future budgets will continue to prioritize and manage
8:29
expens es to keep tax increases at modest levels so how do we do this right
8:34
so one is higher sales tax revenue we were extremely fortunate in that um I
8:41
negotiated a 10-year sales tax sharing agreement with the county starting in 20123 if you look at the graph on the
8:48
bottom right that graph is from 2015 to 2024 sales tax revenue in millions of
8:56
dollars so previously we were getting the four 4 million range each year the
9:01
first year of the New Deal bumped that to 6 million the second year to 6.2 million that's a $1.3 million increase
9:08
from the 4.9 before the deal to the 6.2 in this year that 1.3 million I just
9:15
told you the property tax total for the city is 13 million so the sales tax
9:21
revenue of an extra 1.3 is the equivalent of 10% of our property tax
9:27
revenue right so that's a big piece of the puzzle right and we expect that
9:33
sales tax revenue to continue in each of the next eight years that's the deal that we've gotten so we're very pleased
9:39
with that that has permitted us to keep taxes lower so it's a big piece of our funding different differential the other
9:46
piece is revenue from new construction the city and taxpayers continue to
9:51
benefit from new property construction and Renovations which added $37 Million
9:56
last year to our tax base and 178 million in the past 5 years when I
10:03
translate that that's the graph on the bottom the chart on the bottom left all right the first row is for each of the
10:10
years 2021 to 2025 the growth of the total tax levy
10:16
right that $13 million as I mentioned the 2025 budget is a 3.8% increase on
10:24
that total what's underneath it is the state's calculation of new constr
10:29
construction which is part of the calculation and the property tax cap and what you can see is that this the growth
10:36
of the tax levy is made up in large part by new construction so for instance in
10:43
2025 while our total Levy went up 3.8% our new construction was 1.9 and that
10:50
new construction brings in tax revenue that wasn't there before so everyone else's tax bill only has to cover the
10:57
difference Okay so that's the benefit of new construction that we're seeing that between the new sales tax revenue and
11:05
new construction that's the how we manage to keep the tax increases below
11:11
inflation and below the state tax cap it isn't Magic it's just watching the alternative s sources of revenue we also
11:19
are looking at new Revenue sources the mayor's you know my 2025 budget added
11:24
two new Revenue sources to help reduce pressure on property taxes 2% occupancy
11:31
tax on hotel and short-term rentals so that's designed to get our visitors to pay some of our tax bill right and we
11:38
believe that's will be a revenue Source not as significant as these two I've shown on the page but will make a
11:43
difference the other one is a share for the city of the state cannabis tax from
11:49
dispensaries here in the city finally um mayor the city administrator and the finance director
11:55
we spend much of our time focusing on these numbers seeking non-property tax sources of revenue prioritizing and
12:02
timing our spending and borrowing only what we need with the city's strong aa2
12:08
M Moody's Bond rating so let me take a second a bond rating is what the Wall
12:13
Street folks are saying is the risk associated with buying bonds from this city a aa2 rating Duchess County has a
12:21
better rating I don't think anyone in the area in the county does has as good a rating as we do I think the couple of
12:27
them match it but it's a very strong rating and that makes our borrowing costs lower basically the interest
12:32
that's charged goes down so I just wanted to start with that I know that was complicated um but I like numbers
12:39
you know I like numbers now we'll keep going and show you all the stuff we've done with that so let's go on Mercedes
12:46
you can go to the next slide so let's talk about public safety and of course the story that we're going to talk about
12:52
is the fire station if there we go so our most obvious and largest
12:58
accomplishment in 2024 was the ontime on-budget opening of our city's new
13:03
$14.7 million fire station after more than 20 years of study and debate
13:08
involving far too many sites I require the ReUse of the 1980s compin hose
13:14
Firehouse trimmed down building proposals to the essentials and got the
13:19
new sales tax revenue in this not only minimized the property tax funding that we needed for the firehouse but let us
13:26
also invest in an all electric facility with geothermal heat wells and in a
13:31
beautiful and historically appropriate facade at the Gateway to Main Street in November I was honored to join elected
13:39
officials the council and almost 300 residents for a ribbon cutting and Community celebration of the dedication
13:44
of the firehouse the station houses all our firefighters in one location with
13:49
state-of-the-art equipment which has already improved operations training and safety it also honors the proud history
13:56
of our three volunteer companies with memorials and front of the building and displays of extensive memorabilia inside
14:04
in 2025 we will be selling our two older and obsolete firehouses which is
14:11
essential for financing a portion of the new one with protections on those sales
14:16
to ensure historic preservation we will also be seeking to replace our current ladder truck which while not yet
14:23
outdated is costing more than expected to maintain police we added another
14:29
civilian dispatcher in 2024 which is both cost effective and frees up officers to be out in the community that
14:36
said our police department has many vacancies this reflects the national issue with retirements and attrition
14:43
outpacing new Recruitment and training we were able to promote many of our existing officers including the
14:48
appointment of our new Chief Tom figlia working with our senior officers and Union the city is pursuing ways to
14:55
attract and retain officers including uh with increase compensation and other
15:00
benefits these efforts are starting to pay off as we are slowly filling openings but we will be incurring higher
15:07
overtime expense in the interim finally on Public Safety is EMS um the city
15:13
provided its second year of funding for BAC that's the beacon volunteer Ambulance Corp and funded Advanced life
15:19
support services from ambulance um we continue to work with both to improve coverage capacity and maintain excellent
15:26
response times if we can go on to the next slide Mercedes
15:32
thanks so now I'll turn to infrastructure investment besides the firehouse um in the past four years
15:38
we've been working on major Capital Investments um and in particular we want
15:44
you know we're continuing to methodically modernize and improve our Century old infrastructure with phased
15:51
timing of our project expenses and then maximizing non-property tax funding the
15:57
first one as you well know that we talk about is rebuilding Fishkill teller Avenue in addition to the new Central
16:03
fire station the other major project of 2024 was finally completing the
16:08
preparations for and the launching of The Rehabilitation of teller and Fishkill Avenue this effort takes back
16:15
to 2001 and had the City ad had City administrator Chris White not prioritize
16:21
the time intensive RightWay acquisition process and the final engineering design
16:27
we would have lost 9 million in state and federal funding this work is more than half complete and on time
16:35
despite unexpected below ground discoveries and is slated for completion by the summer of
16:41
2025 this follows our recent endn repaving and sidewalk bump outs on Main Street and also the partial repaving of
16:48
Route 9d um other roads and sidewalks our Highway Department last year milled and
16:55
repaved 28 streets uh continuing our yearly cycle of systematic repaving in
17:01
other projects we installed 34 Ada curb ramps sidewalks on West Center Street
17:06
and rebuilt the exterior staircases at City Hall from beakman Street up to Main Street in
17:12
2025 we will extend sidewalks and repave Route 52 to the city limit rebuild the
17:18
walcot Avenue sidewalks along South Avenue Park repave more streets plus
17:23
parking lots at Memorial Park and also at the van nidc parking lot and continue to stripe side streets off Main Street
17:31
to improve parking Water and Sewer the water department began a city-wide water meter
17:37
replacement project in 2024 installing Smart Meters that allow the city and residents to monitor water
17:45
usage online we also continue to modernize the city's aging sewer system with the construction of a new West Main
17:52
Pump Station and force Main and rebuilt the Box Culvert for water runoff underneath Washington Avenue
17:59
we'll complete complete these projects in 2025 and then begin replacement of the
18:04
mount Beacon water supply tank what you see on the page is uh if you look carefully the one on the left is the um
18:14
um platform for George Washington's head and they're moving we advance mayor oh
18:20
I'm sorry it's been Advanced yeah got it I have an advanced mine okay so what's
18:26
on the screen is the West Main pump state so that really really big crane on
18:31
the top right was needed to do some of that work and it took a bit longer than
18:37
we were thinking because there some of the discoveries we made there okay uh wastewater treatment plant and
18:44
the transfer station in 2024 we upgraded the wastewater treatment plants primary
18:50
settling tanks and renovated staff locker room and showers we also did a full window replacement and cleanout of
18:56
our recycling center which is also the the old incinerator building in 2025 we
19:02
replace the plant's dewatering system an aeration blower and we just completed its roof replacement at a substantial
19:09
cost savings also this year we're making improvements for our Municipal Building using City staff were sensible to Safe
19:16
cost including renovating the police locker room and dispatch area exterior
19:21
and interior painting and repairs and also reconfiguring the city clerk window
19:26
area and then our dummy light amazingly survived the year uh our much loved and
19:32
much rammed uh light maybe the striping and the signage helped don't know so
19:39
let's go to enhanced quality of life that would be the next slide that you've got it up thank you we continue to
19:45
increase the programming budget and make Capital investments in Parks and Recreation as well as other aspects of
19:50
our community's quality and life quality of life um so let's just talk about that
19:58
first of all this is on the bottom right of that uh picture on the screen with our veterans we celebrated our 100th
20:05
anniversary of the city's memorial building on Main at teller this is the only municipal building in the region
20:11
built to honor our veterans we have forged a great partnership with veterans groups over the last years winning
20:18
substantial grants uh to modernize the building and much more extensive use of it by veterans and the entire Community
20:25
expect more events there in 2025 and 26 as we approach the n's 250th
20:31
birthday the Recreations and Parks budget that's the chart on the left um the budget for 2024 exceeded a
20:40
million dollar for the first time ever so this is recreation parks University
20:45
settlement the pool and adult Recreation if I've got that right um 10 years ago
20:52
the same budgets were just over 300,000 so what you're seeing in the chart is uh starting in 2010
20:59
the parks and wck budget the items that I mentioned in millions and so. 26 on
21:05
the 2010 is 260,000 and the 1.0 in 2024 is a million dollars so you
21:12
can see the Investments that we've made in programming this is just the programming component what's not
21:18
included here are the capital Investments that we've done uh to our parks and also to University settlement
21:25
and you've seen those results both at Memorial Park uh at Green Street Park and you'll be seeing them this year at
21:31
South Avenue Park so we've made substantial investments in our Parks and
21:37
Recreation um in 2024 that included the Reconstruction of the we play playground
21:45
the toddler park that's uh the ribbon cutting at the top right uh with new
21:50
play structures surfacing fencing and site and amenities in 2025 at South
21:56
Avenue Park we will be refurbishing the tennis in the basketball courts and installing public bathrooms and Memorial
22:02
Park will see upgrades to the skate park fencing and also its parking lot Main Street last fall um was named
22:11
one of three in New York ranked nationally we're 28th out of 100 as
22:17
amongst the cleanest main streets in America this recognition complemented the prior years U Walker Paradise
22:25
listing for Beacon which got a 96 out of 100 100 in walkability scores so these are external assessments of our Main
22:33
Street and our ability to walk U to get to where we need to in Beacon let me talk about the rail trail
22:40
uh at the city's urging Duchess County Planning completed a feasibility study in late 2024 of converting the beacon
22:47
Hopewell rail spur into a rail trail which will be presented
22:52
tonight um uh in uh right after this is done so we're really pleased to see you
22:58
and we look forward to hearing what you've got we are encouraged that this study will build momentum for the next steps of engineering design and planning
23:06
I have made the rail trail my personal top priority for 2025 and Beyond and I'm
23:12
excited at the prospect of a rail trail connecting our Waterfront and our main street to the 700 mile Empire State
23:19
trail system also I recently testified with my strong support of the proposed fiord
23:25
trail from Beacon to Breakneck Ridge and maybe to spring too the city is working
23:30
with the Fjord Trail to locate a future Trail maintenance facility at our transfer station our maintenance
23:36
facility partnership with them will help accelerate Trail Construction in Beacon and connect to our Parks our trails and
23:43
our train station um I also established a committee to look at Route 52 and to um
23:49
thinking how it will shift gradually from largely commercial and Industrial uses to include most more mixed
23:56
residential and Retail uses that includes planning for connections to the directly adjacent rail trail and
24:03
an access road to our schools in the camp Beacon area and finally let me talk briefly about um housing and
24:09
affordability Duchess County planning so it's your second plug of the evening has recognized that Beacon continues to do
24:15
more than its fair share to improve housing and affordability in the county with almost 30% of Beacon's rental units
24:22
in affordable programs second only to the city of pyy we have encouraged the
24:27
county to look developing part of its DMV lot on Main Street to include affordable units the state has
24:33
recognized Beacon as a pro housing community opening up funding options Metro North is reviewing proposals to
24:40
build housing on top of its north parking lot and this project would be fully consistent with our current zoning
24:47
and includes 10% below market rate units in addition New York state has just announced that Beacon qualified for
24:53
State funding for homeowners to build accessory dwelling units under the plus one Adu program so lots there more to
25:02
come um let's go on to climate leadership thank you Mercedes so as lifelong environmentalists Chris and I
25:09
are committed to making Beacon a model of sustainability in the Hudson Valley Beacon was one of the first and one of
25:15
only 15 of, 1600 local governments in New York to achieve the state's highest
25:20
silver certified climate smart Community status which gives us access to Grants that fund additional sustainability
25:27
efforts in 2025 we expect to install a photovoltaic system at top the city's
25:34
Highway garage to add to the city's self-generated electric capacity the
25:39
city already generates over 70% of its electric needs from solar arrays here in the city um and purchases renewable
25:47
energy credits for the rest the city will continue to grow its all electric and hybrid Fleet in
25:55
2025 and uh taking advantage of State climate smart grants to finance the
26:02
purchases we added EV charging stations at our fire station lot and this year we will see additional Chargers installed
26:09
at other Municipal sites as we mentioned our Central fire station is fully
26:14
sustainable right all electric high efficiency insulation geothermal heating and cooling and natural lighting and
26:21
then last year we continue to grow our popular Municipal composting program we increase the number of composting toter
26:28
we washed them each week at pickup and we provided clearer instructions on how to use it effectively and then finally
26:35
in 2024 we earned our long-standing tra status as a tree City Planning 55 trees
26:42
including those from a new program for property owners to purchase and plant trees at a large discount we also
26:48
expanded our pollinator footprint including a 2500 square foot uh
26:54
pollinator patch that's in front of the city's hidden Brook rural Park
27:00
and you can see trees on the bottom of this one photo uh the Chargers on the
27:05
left the composters on the right and hopefully uh the fur Trail when it
27:10
comes let me talk good government real quick and then let me close um all of the above projects could not have been
27:16
done without the ongoing effort of our City's Workforce and managers who have saved taxpayers hundreds of thousands of
27:21
dollars by preparing building sites doing in-house Renovations and managing
27:27
effectively Chris and I are committed to providing residents of Beacon with a professionally run City one that uses
27:34
taxpayer funds effectively provide Superior infrastructure and services is
27:39
responsive to Residents that empowers our department managers and develops our
27:45
employees terms of Labor Relations the uh we have a strong collaborative
27:50
relationship with our employees and our three unions in late 2024 we negotiated
27:55
a new three-year contract with CSEA which which covers half the city's Workforce in light of higher inflation
28:03
in 2021 and 22 this agreement provides a sizable three-year salary increase in
28:10
2025 the city will be negotiating new contracts with our fire and our police unions our investments in staff and
28:17
management style are paying off as the city is becoming known as a local employer of choice that allows us to
28:24
attract and hire strong and motivated candidates our new city planner joined in
28:29
2024 our full-time HR Director continues to improve Workforce policies training
28:35
and support and we are in the midst of hiring a new building inspector well actually we hope to be approving him
28:41
tonight uh and expect first responder hires to come both fire and police and
28:47
then Beacon continues to record live stream and air on cable all Council
28:52
planning and zoning board meetings we regularly share city news on our website

beacon hop will rail trail Tom beard and Chris hanset from um uh Barton and Le
30:56
Judas gentlemen thank you
31:02
gentlemen thank you uh so I'll kick us off uh just again uh my name is Mark devald programmed administrator for The
31:10
Duchess County transportation Council DCTC for short uh just some quick
31:16
background about us because most folks don't know who the DCTC is uh but we are
31:21
a small Transportation Planning division within the County Planning Department we're based in pipy uh it's three staff
31:28
including myself and our primary role is to carry out this ferally prescribed
31:35
Metropolitan planning process we are what's called a metropolitan planning organization or no noos are established
31:43
across the us through federal law uh we are established in 1982 and it's our responsibility to
31:50
program prioritize Federal planning dollars and project dollars so as a
31:56
background on this study this is a federally funded planning study uh there is no cost to our local municipalities
32:03
for this effort uh we do a lot of planning work uh we've done some uh complete streets planning in the city a
32:09
few years ago uh we do Transit planning pedestrian planning Corridor planning uh
32:15
you name it uh if it's moving uh whether we're on Wheels feet um we're covering
32:21
it uh we also program Project funding and so the Fishkill teller project I
32:26
think uh most folks are very familiar with is a project ferally funded that came through our planning process so we
32:33
handled both the planning side and the project side so uh for this uh we're
32:38
really excited and we' like to thank the mayor and the uh Chris and the council for giving us this opportunity to talk
32:45
about the beacon hopwell rail trail feasibility study uh and just uh a minor
32:50
correction we're not done with the study just yet uh we are getting close uh we do hope to have this finished up this
32:56
spring summer uh but we're well into uh this process and we're actually excited
33:02
to talk about what we found in our existing conditions uh from our fieldwork and also what we're thinking
33:07
about as some preliminary Design Concepts so I think we'll uh kick off the PowerPoint and hopefully that'll
33:13
work for us okay next slide please Mercedes
33:19
having a little bit of technical problems thank you give us one minute we'll get
33:25
there yep and it's only 200 slides so it should
33:31
take us a couple hours to get through this now we're trying to keep it short before you um so we can do the next
33:36
slide y great uh just a quick overview of what we're going to try to talk about today uh we' got the introductions Set
33:44
uh we'll talk about the study goals uh progress to date uh chat about the existing conditions along the corridor
33:50
overall some of the structures uh some of the natural resource issues and then talk about some of the preliminary uh
33:56
trail design ideas that we have uh and we'll dive into any open discussion or answer any questions folks have so next
34:04
slide please great um as we do with many of
34:09
our studies uh we try to we certainly involve the local community and agency
34:15
stakeholders uh so we do have an advisory committee established for this study that's helping guide the process
34:21
of course the city of Beacon is a participant member of that advisory committee uh we have the town of
34:26
Fishkill Village of Fishkill town of East Fishkill a New York State DOT big player of course and of course MTA and
34:33
then Cena Hudson uh developing that uh F Trail so so come of the key uh
34:39
stakeholders involved It's always important to get those folks on board so there are no surprises during the
34:45
planning process so we can reach some level of consensus on the recommendations and the path forward of
34:52
course and I'm joined by Chris and Tom from our consultant team and Chris will uh dive into the PowerPoint in just a
34:59
bit so next slide please uh just a quick snapshot of our
35:04
study goals uh know three major tasks of course you want to develop a a sense of
35:10
you know what are the challenges benefits of developing a trail along the
35:16
beacon line uh that's going from the city of Beacon out to Hobo Junction in East Fishkill as we're most probably all
35:23
familiar it's an abandoned rail line it's still currently owned by Metro nor North so they're key player and
35:29
consideration uh moving forward uh but right now we're in the middle of task two so we're you know we've kind of done
35:35
the field work we've looked at the existing conditions and now we're diving into you know what what would this Trail
35:41
look like and we'll look at some specifics including major road Crossings
35:46
uh what the state of the structures are uh some of the natural resource considerations that we have to take into
35:51
account and then task three uh again kind of wrapping up and finishing up but getting a final product that lays out
35:57
the recommendations possible phasing and all important cost estimates for what
36:03
would it take to get a trail done and next slide
36:10
please and quick background uh again this is the uh Beacon line it's a 13m
36:16
section of the beacon line uh it's been abandoned by uh the MTA Metro North so
36:23
it's unused uh but it still exists uh and it's a consideration that we have to be aware of as we move forward uh but
36:30
there's a lot of opportunity here and as a mayor mentioned it does tie into the river and then also the Empire State
36:36
trail Dutchess rail trail walkway over the Hudson you really can get a lot of access across the region and the state
36:43
with this Trail it really really closes the gap between the river and the rail
36:48
trail and P State trail so a very it's a win-win uh situation and it looks very
36:53
obvious uh as a good Improvement next slide please
36:58
and so I'm going to hand it off to Chris who's going to talk about our progress today and some existing conditions
37:04
findings and our path forward all right thank you Mark uh as
37:11
he said I'm Chris hannet I'm the project manager uh from Barton Judith uh consulting firm that was uh retained uh
37:17
by the county to do this project um so to date um Metro North uh has rail bank
37:25
this uh railroad Corridor um um meaning that essentially they don't have any uh
37:31
intent to use this as a railroad Corridor right now uh but it's rail bank in the future meaning that if in the
37:37
future they want to come back and use the railroad Corridor they would be allowed to um so it uh yeah uh we also
37:45
did field work uh completed that um in early last year in the spring April to
37:51
2024 we also had a project uh project Outreach um session where we established
37:58
a website for the project um conducted an online survey we also conducted a
38:03
couple pop-up events in Beacon and East Fishkill uh last spring as well um intended the beacon Farmers Market here
38:09
and that was very uh exciting actually that was fun um next slide that was a good event um got a lot of good uh
38:16
feedback from um everybody that attended that event there um Andy's fish kill as
38:21
well just good uh good interaction with everybody um on that so this is just
38:27
what our study website looks like um and again anyone can visit it's still up right now for more information uh we
38:33
also have the existing conditions uh report up right there um up right now on
38:39
the study website anyone like to take a look at that as well um that's on there
38:47
next so on that public survey um we received well over a thousand comments
38:53
uh and responses to the online survey um majority of everybody that respond responded supported the rail trail um we
39:01
uh asked a lot questions there such as what amenities would people like to see
39:06
uh restrooms was number one uh and then some typical uh amenities you know benches waste receptacles wayf finding
39:13
signage um and key uses that people expect biking walking and connecting to other rail Trails again this Trail
39:19
really would provide a great connection um here within city of Beacon uh right down to the river and then for people
39:27
out side of the city as well to get into the city of Beacon or get down to the river as well so um I think a lot of the
39:33
people are uh ex excited to see this Trail too so
39:42
next U Mercedes next I think it was loading um again here just a quick
39:49
snapshot of what the public survey looked like um we did allow people to pinpoint where they would like to see
39:54
certain amenities and everything so one of the big hotpots on that uh on the corridor was uh right in the village of
40:01
Fishkill there um and then a chart there just highlighting uh what people want to
40:07
see you see there over 600 people voted for uh for restrooms there um along the
40:12
corridor sometimes so that would certainly be a consideration at Trail heads um some way shape or form
40:21
next so continuing on on the progress to date uh we conducted a traffic assessment of seven study intersections
40:27
within the corridor uh there were there were more intersections but there were seven major ones that we identified that
40:33
we needed to study more in depth uh within the city that's Church Hill Street here and East Main Street uh we
40:39
also um had a meeting with Central Hudson Gas and Electric to review
40:45
Crossing points and uh their facilities uh that are within or directly adjacent to the corridor um and we have a future
40:52
meeting with Con Edison set up or we will be setting that up to discuss uh a line Crossing that they have as well so
41:03
next uh again that existing conditions report is up there on the study website
41:09
um and that report overall found the majority of the corridor is in very good condition um there are manageable
41:16
challenges we like to call them um sometimes a lot of the report just focuses on some of the challenges that
41:22
are in there but really it's the important takeaway is that the majority of the corridor is in really good
41:28
condition um for use by a trail not necessarily a
41:33
railroad um we also presented Trail Concepts to
41:38
advisory uh committee meeting um that uh Mark mentioned before um we've had two
41:44
meetings with them or three meetings with them so far um presented the uh
41:50
concept plans to them most recently here in December next
41:58
uh so the two major Concepts that we looked at and then presented at that meeting were rail to Trail and ra rail
42:04
with Trail um couple key takeaways from these
42:09
Concepts rail two Trail uh would retain the existing Corridor mostly as it's uh
42:16
as it is now uh the infrastructure the shape of the corridor would mostly be maintained the bridges that are out
42:23
there right now the six Bridges would be reused um for the trail use and for
42:31
um pedestrian or for emergency vehicle use maintenance vehicle use um and all
42:37
that um little to no rightaway Acquisitions required on that as well uh
42:43
whereas rail with Trail um one of the major challenges to that would be
42:48
maintaining an offset from the tracks that are there now so so Chris just to be clear rail with Trail means you don't
42:54
pull the tracks correct and you build the trail with the tracks still there yes thank you so with the main takeaway
43:00
yes is rail to Trail we would remove the tracks not we but you know uh rail with Trail the tracks would remain for
43:08
potential use as the trail is operating so that's why we would want to have an
43:14
offset from the track so then trains could theoretically run adjacent to the trail with it um and still both function
43:21
so there are significant construction costs due to new Bridges Culvert extensions um fill in areas where um it
43:30
slopes down from the existing tracks now on both sides there's environmental impacts due to the fish kill Creek uh
43:36
flood Plaines Wetlands tree clearing uh and other physical constraints as well
43:41
um you know Jason roadways like such down as right down here city of Beacon uh you know right next to Main Street
43:47
and everything and all the buildings that are through there so um but let not to say the rail 2 Trail isn't without
43:54
challenges as well next
43:59
um it's again overall Corridor is in really good shape uh we assess the
44:04
overall Corridor uh structures and natural resources as part of that um existing conditions
44:16
next uh of the existing railroad ballast that's out there now the stone that's below the railroad tracks and ties uh
44:22
75% of it is in good or excellent condition uh with very little veget growing through it or um and it really
44:30
still maintains a uh a clean surface for that stone and it's deep as well um
44:36
drainage 14 large culverts nine small culverts um we assessed all the culverts
44:41
that were out there and again this is along the entire Corridor um not just within the city of Beacon uh there's
44:47
only about four miles or so within the city of Beacon of this uh of the entire
44:53
13- M Corridor um we looked at potential access points where uh people from other
44:58
neighborhoods and everything could get to the uh railroad Corridor and then uh what existing Parks could be used as
45:05
well um we documented utilities and we documented all the railroad crossings next Road Crossings excuse
45:13
me uh summary of the natural resources um vegetation and trees are really were
45:18
no areas where um trees or vegetation were growing up within or immediately
45:25
adjacent to the railroad tracks um that could be a major obstacle but in this case it was not again the corridor is
45:31
mostly in really good shape um three name streams uh that were crossed by
45:38
this project uh there's Wetlands adjacent to the tracks um in some areas
45:43
uh Fishkill and East Fishkill mostly um flood ples 5 miles of the corridor is
45:49
within a flood plane of the Fishkill Creek uh that's mostly out um on the
45:54
Eastern uh Eastern section of the Corridor uh cultural resources of course there's some historic sites around the
46:01
project um and then you know of course right down here in the city of beac and then uh endangered species we identified
46:07
Indiana bat Boog Turtle Monarch Bly um among others as well so next
46:14
slide so right now I'll take you uh through a um walk along the corridor uh
46:20
starting at the Hudson River um I don't recommend that anybody walks the corridor because it is technically
46:26
private a property that's owned by the railroad um so we had to get access passes when we went out there and uh
46:32
that took some time uh to get but we were allowed out there but um again
46:38
private property so don't walk along so starting at the Hudson River there um right next to the riverfront trail uh
46:44
that they filled that in with uh um some stone dust right now to make it part of the trail um so and then we got the
46:52
Madden BR uh Brett Park uh overlooking the Ty hatf right there um in the
46:58
background on the right next
47:04
slide uh we got another section of the railroad tracks there straight um right along Ty AV there uh right next to a new
47:12
development that's going in right now um apartment complex I believe 248
47:19
248 it's impressive um and then
47:25
uh a little uh encroachment there uh by one of the adjacent Property Owners
47:30
there um in the city of Beacon that's just uh west of uh Church Hill Street
47:35
there um property is owned by the silos Beacon LLC um some of their equipment
47:41
and uh um Stone there is piled up within the uh within the railroad Corridor so uh
47:48
it's not the only instance that we noticed of this happening uh throughout the railroad Corridor so next slide
47:57
um moving along we got uh the railroad old railroad station Hudson Valley
48:03
Brewery there uh right next to um that's looking just east of Church Hill Street there and then uh looking East along
48:10
Main Street uh right in front of uh the trackx coffee shop um I got coffee there
48:16
when I was out in the out in the project site it was pretty good um right along East Main Street there so next slide
48:28
uh then overlooking uh one of the waterfalls along the Fishkill Creek uh again just west of East Main or east
48:34
east of East Main Street uh and then another section of the railroad tracks there um that is behind the wish I could
48:44
read that writing there the niche uh mod building I believe one of the warehouses
48:50
there as well right uh so railroad Corridor is right there sandwiched in between the Fishkill Creek and the uh in
48:57
the building so you can see like in these pictures right here how challenging it would be to put a trail
49:02
adjacent to those existing railroad tracks that's offset 25 ft next
49:10
slide um so this picture on the left taken right behind the caravana building uh
49:17
along Route 52 and then at the end there um that last photo there on the right is
49:23
uh near the M Street uh area in the apartment building buildings there uh adjacent Route 52
49:34
next drain characteristics within the corridor um within the city of Beacon uh
49:39
really we only had some small pipe culverts uh within the project so within the area so there's two uh two instances
49:47
of pipe culs right there um one at the end of Newland Mills Road there and the
49:53
other one uh near Ty F next and most of the drainage structure in
49:59
these small coverts and everything appeared to be functioning pretty well um Without Really any major concerns uh
50:05
with those um we did notice uh a couple instances of um this here where it looks
50:14
like we have a drainage pipe from an adjacent lot or adjacent property that's just dumping into the railroad Corridor
50:21
um this was taken right behind the carvana parking lot there um along Route
50:26
52 uh so you can see that's about a 3ft diameter pipe there that's just um
50:32
during rain drainage storm or rain storms and everything uh dumping water into uh the railroad Corridor which in
50:39
this case luckily there is a larger uh Culvert underneath the railroad tracks there so um it wasn't causing any wash
50:46
outs really but uh if a trail were to come through here we would want to clean up all these instances of this occurring
50:52
here um just make it so it's not going to pose any uh threat to the trail infrastructure that's put in place so
51:01
um next slide there also were two instances of
51:08
what we call uncontrolled drainage Crossing so this is where the that there
51:13
may be um pipes that are dumping water into the rail recorder that did not have a
51:21
culvert that would pass the drainage flows underneath the railroad tracks so
51:26
just east of the route 90 overpass um wav is the picture on the left side
51:31
there um so it's just a depression area that uh has collected water from the
51:37
roadway and other areas of impervious uh surface um the water is collected within
51:42
the railroad tracks uh then on the right side as well um is another instance
51:47
where a pipe is dumping water into the uh Corridor and that's behind the starn
51:54
building and that Niche uh light facility uh these Crossings could be uh
51:59
subject to United States Army Corps and DEC review for jurisdictional Wetlands
52:05
or streams now so they would have to be um assessed in the field for uh Wetland
52:11
characteristics and then uh um jurisdictional requests be sent to Army Corps for those so that would of course
52:18
happen uh during a design phase of the project right now so next
52:25
slide um um just wanted to show this there were two wash outs within the corridor that we uh noticed but these
52:32
were not in the city of Beacon uh these are relatively um straightforward
52:37
repairs both of them um uh the one on the left was about A4
52:43
Mile West of Washington AV uh along the railroad line and the other one was in the village of Fishkill um near the uh
52:51
near the catella park there so next slide but again no major wash outs within the city
52:59
of the six Bridge structures um two of them were in the city uh Bridge number
53:05
one is the Western most bridge that is over the um the railroad tracks that are
53:11
the Hudson Line uh of the MTA Metro North Railroad um and then on the right
53:17
there is the shorter bridge over uh the entrance to um Madam Brett Park and the
53:24
Ty hat factory there uh of course that causes a restriction there uh within that driveway so um next
53:35
Slide the left picture there uh that is a large concrete arch bridge over the
53:41
Fishkill Creek that is just east of the city limits but um wanted to include that just for another idea of what we
53:48
have uh along uh some of the rest of the corridor uh and then we also have one
53:54
overpass which I mentioned a little bit earlier the route 90 you overpass uh also wcat wcot AV over the uh the
54:01
railroad tracks next so one of the ways that we could
54:09
convert these uh railroad bridges into use for pedestrians and uh emergency
54:14
vehicles um would be this here so this is a bridge that's
54:20
outside of the railroad or outside of the city of Beacon right now um it's at the Town Line of the of fish kill town
54:27
of East Fishkill but what we would do in this case is we recommend removing the railroad tracks and the railroad ties
54:33
there leaving the two parallel girds in place and then from there a new deck
54:39
would be installed uh either a concrete deck or a Timber deck and then railings would be added to that as well you know
54:46
to protect people from uh falling into the water there so um we also assessed
54:52
uh these Bridges right now for their structural capacity we did a preliminary uh assessment I should say of them
54:59
were're able to obtain um load ratings that the Metro North Railroad had done on the bridges uh about 10 years ago now
55:06
um they did a course for railroad loading and uh didn't meet modern railroad loading right now a lot of the
55:12
bridges but the loading still should be enough um for pedestrian for emergency
55:18
vehicle access for construction vehicles as well so um there would be repairs likely needed to each of the bridges
55:24
within the corridor but um they should be in relatively good shape for uh for
55:30
use uh and repurposing by a a trail project
55:38
next um so Road Crossings within the project uh within the city of Beacon
55:43
here um we had five five minor crossings that we identified uh within the
55:50
corridor and or within the city and we also had two major Crossings we called them um at East fish East Main Street
55:58
and Church Hill Street um and then some of the minor Crossings were driveways uh
56:05
Denning AV one of them uh M Street uh being another so next
56:14
slide uh so of the Minor Road Crossings uh just want to give example of what uh
56:19
potential treatments could look like uh to facilitate safe uh travel through
56:24
there by pedestrians and by um mil Street uh being the one in this case uh signage and striping um should
56:33
be sufficient in this case uh or is potential option I should say there um it also could be offset a little bit um
56:40
to cross at the intersection there uh with e fish Hill Street and uh um I know
56:47
I believe that's just a blinking light right now but that could be brought uh if that was a traffic signal full
56:52
traffic signal that could be brought there um and you know pedestrian and uh push buttons and everything could be
56:58
installed there too uh as a potential option there uh next
57:04
slide again uh this is just a commercial driveway this is actually just uh east of that Mill Street crossing there this
57:10
is a long uh Crossing but signage and striping should be sufficient through here as well so
57:17
next then of the major road Crossings here we had Church Hill Street and uh East Main Street
57:24
um we have a couple stats on the uh streets there as well so Church Hill Street has roughly a th000 vehicles per
57:31
day uh posted speed limit 30 m hour Crossing length of 22 ft uh East Main
57:37
Street a little bit larger got roughly 5,000 vehicles per day uh post the speed limit of 30 m hour and the crossing
57:43
length uh along the railroad tracks now is about 55 ft next
57:49
slide so potential options for these Crossings uh at Church Hill Street starting there um rapid rectangular
57:57
flashing beacons uh could be an option there um they pedestrian push button
58:02
activated so uh when someone comes up to that Crossing and wishes to cross push a button um lights alternate yellow
58:10
blinking rapidly and uh Vehicles will hopefully stop for them next
58:16
slide as part of this we also recommend that the intersection would be offset uh to the South and that would uh
58:23
offsetting the alignment of the ra a trail as it's going across the rail
58:29
um roadway should help to slow uh bicyclist down as they approach that um
58:35
they're going to have to navigate tighter turns and everything so that um it also brings attention to the fact
58:42
that there's a Crossing there if you're not really paying attention you know you would um you could miss the fact that
58:48
there's a railroad crossing there or road crossing excuse me because you're going to be going straight so having that offset uh brings more attention to
58:55
the fact that they're a road crossing here and hopefully slows people down and uh they look both ways before Crossing
59:01
next slide at East Main Street
59:06
um this one again signage and striping just for this one uh and as you can see there isn't a crosswalk that's already
59:13
adjacent to the railroad tracks there so uh if you go to the next slide we'll um
59:19
the we would recommend that the railroad tracks or the the railroad tracks the
59:24
trail actually gets brought up to cross at that crosswalk there so again it's offsetting the
59:30
intersection um making a little more uh a uh expected Crossing location for
59:38
pedestrians and bicyclists um and this uh alternative right here also shows a
59:44
raised pedestrian Refuge Island um and that Island could uh incorporate that
59:50
dummy light that everyone here loves to hit apparently I've heard
59:56
y so uh maybe if we uh maybe by adding that median there just make that light
1:00:02
stand out a little bit more and um improve how people drive around it uh
1:00:09
maybe that would improve U yeah enhance that visibility of that
1:00:14
light maybe and uh how people are supposed to drive around it so uh that's a potential option but um adding that
1:00:20
Refugee Island as well obviously there's a large stripe median there now so it really shortens the crossing distance
1:00:27
for people um as they're Crossing that roadway they only have to worry about One Direction of traffic uh rather than
1:00:33
both so next uh utility conflicts as we
1:00:42
mentioned earlier we had a meeting with uh Central Hudson electric and uh gas and they do have um transmission lines
1:00:49
and distribution lines crossing the corridor and uh directly adjacent to the railroad Corridor as well uh within this
1:00:56
city of Beacon here we only have a Crossing I believe oh no we also have a uh a section uh further west of this uh
1:01:03
photo here um where the the power lines are adjacent to the railroad Corridor as well so their main concerns were really
1:01:11
just making sure that uh any Trail facility here doesn't um prohibit them from accessing their lines so next slide
1:01:20
uh we also did have a lot of different uh utilities uh noted throughout the corridor uh basically all of them them
1:01:26
water was present in a couple places um sewer as well uh gas right down here in
1:01:34
the city and then um uh a Communications line runs along the entire length of the
1:01:40
corridor as well so um there's going to be a utility uh interest no matter what
1:01:47
so next slide Corridor access locations um right
1:01:54
now this map really just shows uh where a roadway Crossing is and where parks
1:02:00
are that are directly adjacent to the railroad Corridor um so I know mayor you
1:02:06
uh submitted uh and we had a meeting about um access points and everything throughout the corridor so we'll include
1:02:12
that really in the full feasibility study um for that uh so but we for this
1:02:18
meeting we just wanted to highlight where Road Crossings are CU we imagine a lot of people would ride their bikes or
1:02:24
walk uh to one of those Road cross Crossings and then access the the trail um off of one of these uh listed
1:02:30
Crossings here uh and we also um see potential at The Madam brat park there for a trail head uh potentially where
1:02:37
people could drive down um and uh park there as well to to access the corridor
1:02:42
so and then of course there's the long dock Park um that this would eventually connect to uh through the existing trail
1:02:49
system that's there now so next [Music] slide so next steps of the study
1:02:56
um the existing conditions report is already up on the project website um so
1:03:02
right now we're um doing presentations to other municipalities um right before this meeting we had a village of
1:03:08
Fishkill uh presentation so we uh presented to the town of Fishkill a
1:03:14
couple weeks ago and then next week we have the town of East Fishkill uh we also have a virtual public meeting uh
1:03:20
that is March 20th at noon um you can register for that at the Beacon hope
1:03:25
rail tr.com uh register there and you can get a link for that draft report uh
1:03:31
that should be out in Spring of 20 this spring um and after that is released we
1:03:37
would also so the draft report would be the uh recommendations um and the
1:03:42
concepts uh of the corridor and then public meeting number two would occur after that uh with the final report
1:03:49
being released uh sometime this summer next
1:03:58
and that's that Tom thank thank you Chris just a
1:04:03
couple of notes to to take away from this as well is that this is a feasibility study on the potential to
1:04:10
actually be able to build it or not um a lot of funding sources look at projects and some will scratch their head can
1:04:17
they really do that so it sometimes becomes difficult to get funding for projects like these but when you have a study that says we've looked at all the
1:04:24
environmental we looked at the social the other other impacts the the the traffic and and all that and yeah it
1:04:31
works it's a lot easier to get funding and move these projects forward and what I can say is from I experienced 30 years
1:04:37
doing Trails like this this has got great potential there are no real major roadblocks to this uh from a a
1:04:43
structural sense or anything along the corridor so it it definitely can be reasonably built um and it's typically
1:04:51
of typical other Trail rail trail projects and that so so take that away also um some of the things that we've
1:04:57
shown here tonight uh they're not set in stone there are multiple ways to cross minor roadways there are many other
1:05:03
potential connection points there are lots of different ways to do this but what we're showing here is that there
1:05:09
are many ways to to to get this project moving and get it built and the fine
1:05:15
details of each individual connection and that that will come later in the design phase of the project which
1:05:21
hopefully will be soon but it if it's 3 four years out which it very well there some potential of that um some things
1:05:28
may be a little bit different so we'll be adjusted at that point to kind of fit with with the current situation and and
1:05:35
the timing of everything so um you know we're really very excited to have uh
1:05:40
been able to do this project and looked at the study and really appreciate your input and the most one of the most
1:05:45
important things is the positive input get behind this and if you have friends that are really behind the project you
1:05:51
know let's get their comments and get their input that we really get big momentum by behind this to really get it
1:05:57
moving so um with that we'll leave it open if anybody has any questions or anything we'd be more than happy to
1:06:04
entertain them all right Council any
1:06:11
[Music] questions um I'll say that I I really appreciate all of the work that you've
1:06:17
all put into this um and all of these detailed plans are really really helpful
1:06:22
in terms of really envisioning um and understanding what this could could look like um you know I like many beaconites
1:06:29
I'm pretty familiar with that Corridor um I've walked it I won't tell you if I had a permit or not um both on the rail
1:06:37
and also along the greenway Trail um which you're probably familiar with is The Pedestrian um pathway across a
1:06:44
similar Corridor um and you know among a lot of these plans that I I really
1:06:49
appreciate I'm a little concerned about the idea of rail with Trail um there are
1:06:56
many segments of the trail that I'm familiar with where I really don't see it being feasible to um create this 25t
1:07:05
Corridor particularly if that would mean you know infilling Wetlands that would be a major red flag so could you say
1:07:11
more about how that could possibly work in some of these areas that we're looking at sure um in the beginning of
1:07:18
the study uh M MTA uh was still um the
1:07:23
the rail was still considered operating until it reached that rail banking abandonment through the surface
1:07:29
Transportation board which occurred last February um the original uh uh petition
1:07:34
to do that was denied they needed more information so it went through another round and now it was uh part of the
1:07:41
agreement uh between the railroad and the county was to look at both rail uh
1:07:46
with Trail and rail to Trail um so um even with that decision being made that
1:07:51
they had no interest at the moment of doing anything with the trail uh doing with the rail I'm sorry uh we decided to
1:07:57
keep that going because there been another projects that we've worked on and you know talking with the county
1:08:02
this is questions why not do this why not do that so our study started looking into that from the beginning and we'll
1:08:09
continue through and let the engineering and the costs speak for itself as well as the environmental impacts those
1:08:16
narrow areas uh you know behind uh along Route 52 are are you know we're going to
1:08:22
estimate what it would cost to fill that in the Environ Al impacts and all those costs will show up and it's going to be
1:08:28
a very significant difference in cost between the two Alternatives um also all the bridges uh they've uh their own
1:08:35
studies show that they're not rated for railroad anymore they would have to rebuild all of those railroad Bridges um
1:08:42
and then we would have to build pedestrian Bridges alongside of those if we didn't reuse them so there's a lot of
1:08:49
um challenges and a lot of costs associated with those two options but the most important thing is that that at
1:08:55
the end of the study the engineering and the costs will speak for itself uh on
1:09:00
which which way to go with this so um did that answer your question we do we do understand
1:09:09
that yeah I mean yeah I I understand what you're saying that sort of the answer to this question is in the next
1:09:16
phase of the planning um so yes and no you fan my it's it's a really big
1:09:21
challenge it's going to be expensive um we've come across this on many other projects
1:09:26
uh with with that addition of leaving the rail in place and they're just not not feasible in many locations and and
1:09:32
this Corridor has that has many locations that it's really not reasonably feasible you could say those
1:09:37
are the the terms that are used right um but then the costs also will will play into that as well and we do know that
1:09:44
MTA has no intent of uh using this as a rail uh for trains anymore as well so
1:09:51
right wouldn't be losing a feasible purpose by keeping the rail either
1:09:56
correct I'm sorry so we wouldn't be losing a feasible purpose by keeping the uh the tracks in place no no no we we if
1:10:05
we remove the tracks and build the trail part of the design um and the fact that
1:10:11
the ballast is still in pretty good shape we will integrate the next layer of stone to work with that ballast um so
1:10:18
that it wouldn't um preclude tracks from coming back there in the future because with that rail banking if there's some
1:10:25
National Emergency or or some type of need where it had to be for tracks we want to make sure it still could be for
1:10:31
those important reasons but um there only been 10 projects in the whole
1:10:37
country very few miles that have actually gone back to tracks after being rail bank um we don't think that it's
1:10:44
possible here but anything is possible but we haven't seen very much of that over over the over history
1:10:52
so I have a couple of questions um one do do any of the rail trails in the
1:10:59
county um are they do they have lights and are they um like plowed in the
1:11:05
winter time or is it just a seasonal and daylight I think some of the mark you
1:11:11
want to talk about the county yeah yeah the uh for the most part the uh County
1:11:18
trails are not lighted though the north side Trail in pipy is and I think that's
1:11:23
actually one of the few sections that are that are lighted um so it's it's rare but however there could be
1:11:31
consideration for this environment because it is different it's it's more urban Suburban high density um and
1:11:37
there's also the safety security aspect to it that you know that might help um
1:11:43
and so on the plowing um I'd have to check I I'm pretty sure the count P County well it depends on if you use
1:11:50
federal aid uh I'll have to double check how the county maintains yeah they do PL yeah so they they also plow the Hudson
1:11:56
Valley rail trail in olster county and we built the uh Kingston rail trail when I was up at olster County and we have
1:12:03
that Lit as well and with cameras because that was one of the things we discussed a lot of commuters would would
1:12:10
be interested in using this especially since it gets down to the train station um easier um the other question um
1:12:18
neighbors uh across the creek from the line in Beacon had some concerns of
1:12:25
privacy um is there anything that you do to accommodate the the neighboring
1:12:31
residents that's a typical concern and that was actually raised at the town of Fishkill uh certainly some property
1:12:37
owners who are like AB buding uh the corridor you know there's some concerns about you know privacy I think it's on a
1:12:43
case- by case basis typically I know for Dutchess County they typically do not put fencing up uh but I think they will
1:12:50
take into consideration those concerns of property owners and pay potentially put some type of screening whether it
1:12:55
could be vegetative vegetation um so it's not all or nothing okay yeah
1:13:01
sometimes we also uh utilize the the drainage and and build into the design of the trail to make it uh kind of
1:13:09
annoying if you were to get off the trail and try to going through somebody's backyard you know you got to step through this step through that and
1:13:15
and that so sometimes that works too it's kind of a passive thing that you can do for security but the same
1:13:20
question did come up earlier tonight in the village of Fishkill and and it's a case by case basis as Mark said
1:13:26
typically but we are aware of that and have come across it on every project that we've ever done yeah this is unique
1:13:32
because it's across the creek so it's like nobody would get to them but they're just you know it's we we'll
1:13:39
change things yep absolutely yeah yeah thank you I I just add when we start
1:13:44
asking ourselves that question we're in a pretty good place so it's a good question to ask to
1:13:51
have sure sure I'll just ask a couple of question quick questions um is it all or
1:13:57
nothing or are there scenarios where some segment a segment or some segments
1:14:02
might be done while others would not be yeah for for right now um we're we're
1:14:08
dividing it up into phases of construction using manageable funding that may be available um and uh we're
1:14:16
not there yet uh with the estimate of that but it is very likely that it could be built in segments or phases uh for
1:14:22
instance the the the bridge over Route 9 uh maybe its own phase due to the cost
1:14:27
and complexity of what that's happening um you know maybe the beacon section is one phase and and you know so we're
1:14:34
working that out that will be in the feasibility study and it will be kind of a basically a recommendation not set in
1:14:40
stone but something to to kind of guide the guide the funding by so hopefully we
1:14:45
can get all the money at once and yes build it is one big project but you know we have to be realistic too sometimes
1:14:50
with expectations just to follow up on that versus phasing is there possibility that some segments just would not be feasible
1:14:57
but other parts would still go forward um each of the segments the whole entire court are definitely feasible and um one
1:15:05
thing that you know going through some of the existing conditions that that Chris did and the thing that that I want
1:15:10
you to take away from this that it it's not that bad of a of a lift to build this build this Trail there aren't uh
1:15:17
big obstacles there aren't major environmental concerns uh we don't have any real hazardous materials to worry
1:15:23
about either we can cap them off uh with other with stone in the top core so
1:15:29
those types of things usually uh make projects very difficult but we don't have that on this Corridor um this is
1:15:35
all buildable and reasonably too so with the two Trail not necessarily with Trail
1:15:41
though not necessarily rail with Trail no rail to Trail last quick question is is there consideration of any
1:15:47
construction of parking lots at any segment of the trail yes each of those locations for trail heads will be vetted
1:15:54
uh through the preliminary design process once we get past the feasibility study so we've identified some areas
1:16:00
that could be Trail heads but we we haven't done any we won't we won't do any design on the actual parking layouts
1:16:06
but everything is open uh for possibility uh from this point forward and even going through the next phase of
1:16:13
the project would would be the design of sections or the whole Trail itself so nothing's really off the table as far as
1:16:19
the parking I know is important so is MTA a Cooperative player in this
1:16:28
yes they anticipated they've been very good so far we we got our third rail training
1:16:34
before we could go on the corridor even though there's no third rail out there but so uh but they were they were they've been helpful very helpful ever
1:16:40
since on that so uh yes they've been
1:16:46
helpful can you talk a little bit about the role of the city if you get to the phase of wanting to go after funding
1:16:52
kind of What kinds of things you might come back and want want and benefit from us to help move this forward um yeah
1:16:58
Chris White has volunteered to be the project manager and director of all I've got my checkbook out I'll be leaving the country shortly
1:17:05
we'll have a GoFundMe as well um yeah the role the role of the city it really
1:17:11
it really depends on uh you know how the funding comes through and as you're probably aware there's with many
1:17:16
different sources of funding there are many different strings attached to the way the funding is administered and how it's uh procured for the actual uh
1:17:25
design team and and for the sponsor of the project so um it is it's possible that the the city could be the project
1:17:31
sponsor for a section of the trail and do the administration on the design and construction of it um and then
1:17:37
maintenance agreements have to be looked at too whether it's individual minicipal by municipality or it's the county which
1:17:44
I'm not supposed to say Mark looked up over here but we don't know yet it's going to depend a lot on how the funding
1:17:49
gets set up and one of our projects that we worked with Chris on had I think was six seven different funding sources on
1:17:55
the asoken rail trail um and that was just a man managing all of those different funding sources to make one
1:18:01
conglomerate project that could happen here too but it it really is very dependent on the specific uh a raise
1:18:08
grant for instance could be $30 million and that could you know get up uh some high high amount of uh work under that
1:18:15
particular contract could be $10 million as well so um but tap grants are limited of $5 million and then other programs
1:18:22
are 500,000 1.5 million so it really depends on how they piece together and the timing of them as well so it is very
1:18:30
variable so I don't have a real definitive answer for you but the city likely would be a uh sponsor and be take
1:18:37
part in the management of the trail design and construction of the project as well more than likely that that would
1:18:43
occur so thank you okay and again with the Hudson Valley rail trail which
1:18:48
connects the walkway to the walkill valley rail trail and is the Empire State trail the town did a project the
1:18:55
county did a project the do did the rest of it so it might be a patchwork of of
1:19:01
of different segments being done by different entities yeah maybe one other thing related is I can't I don't know
1:19:07
enough about the details of the fiord trail but I think there might be some at least adjacent or potential crossover is
1:19:13
that something that you're thinking of as well even if it's TBD on what exactly that is yes a a representative from CA
1:19:20
Hudson and the F Trail is part of our our advisory committee and they plan on connecting right to it and and uh we're
1:19:27
going to we're coordinating that at the same time yes so that's going to be a continuity piece of point of continuity
1:19:33
for this for this Trail also we're hoping so great y all right sorry have
1:19:40
more question um are you at the design phase where you're looking at um the level of use detail where we know if it
1:19:48
would be an accessible path are we talking about a dedicated bike lane for the whole Trail is that a mixed use of
1:19:56
recreational and commuter use along the trail um do you have answers or visions
1:20:02
for those kinds of questions yet um right now we're at uh a 12T width um
1:20:09
there's potential surface would be uh a crush Stone mix or asphalt um that's
1:20:15
about the extent of that um and then it's really going to depend on um some more detailed analysis of what it would
1:20:21
be but generally uh that will be Ada comp uh as well even a stone surface can be
1:20:28
ADA Compliant um you know we've done that that's in in place in many places right now um so it's really uh up to uh
1:20:37
the specifics and once it gets down to the design phase we're still we're just a feasibility study right now not love
1:20:44
to get going but we you know we got to keep keep it in check just to the feasibility phase for this moment we
1:20:49
want to get to the point where we can answer those questions yeah yes
1:20:55
yeah so all right so I just want to thank you all for coming um so the um uh
1:21:03
first piece has been completed and you're working on the second phase expected to finish up the by the summer
1:21:09
I've got that now that I understand it and I'm very appreciative of you coming here um you you good you want to got one
1:21:16
I don't have a question the only thing I would add is that this presentation was not part of the agenda for the public or for the council in advance so I would
1:21:23
want to make sure the coun gets that and that this is also accessible to the public we'll upload it tomorrow we thank
1:21:29
you we got it late so and we have our official first public information
1:21:35
meeting on on March 20th that will'll be everybody's invited for that that have a a combination of all the different
1:21:42
municipalities in one uh much longer and a little bit more detailed in in some
1:21:47
aspects of it so and again that information was available on your website it's on the front page people
1:21:53
can register for that public comment session and please do good thank you all
1:21:58
right thank you all very much okay
1:22:06
um so if people were here for that or want to head out this would be a good
1:22:13
time to take a minute to do that and then we'll keep going from
1:22:19
there thanks again we close
1:22:25
yeah we'll we'll get out the March 20th we're going to
1:22:30
post all right so um our next piece and I
1:22:38
appreciate everyone hanging out for that but uh now we'll get to public comment so if you have something that uh you
1:22:46
want to say you'll get 3 minutes uh I have a signup sheet but there isn't a long list on it let's see if I can find
1:22:52
it there's only one name on it Fran
1:23:00
Riley oh okay all right um if anyone wants to make a public comment this
1:23:06
would be the time to do so come on up tell us who you are where you live and you got three
1:23:12
minutes you took that list pretty quick tonight first I just want to say don't
1:23:18
even think of moving the dummy light history and historic preservation are the fabric of this city however every
1:23:24
day we are witnessing it being pulled apart at the seams by overdevelopment why are we not thinking
1:23:30
outside the box the Nabisco box printing Factory turned into Dia and we know how
1:23:36
that turned out today we get to think even bigger our city boomed in the early 1900s with the mount Beacon incline
1:23:43
railroad estimates of 600 60,000 riders in its first season particularly with
1:23:50
day Trippers from New York City who would arrive by Steamboat to Newberg and then to ferry across to Beacon to access
1:23:56
the mountain to escape the Heat and the overcrowded tenements to enjoy the fresh air the mountain and its Casino dance
1:24:02
hall the city of Beacon now has that same golden opportunity to offer the state something unique we must save the
1:24:09
rail spur and bring a light rail system that can offer a similar experience with
1:24:15
accessibility to all to meet the needs of all users young and old with and
1:24:21
without disabilities let's transport residents and visitors up from the Riverside train station into the City
1:24:27
and Beyond with stops along Route 9d at Ty Main Street of Churchill and groveville bypassing and leaving
1:24:34
congestion of cars behind and Municipal parking lots we have a short window so don't blow it on a rail trail path a a
1:24:43
walking trail I can cite a dozen studies with similar numbers Danbury Connecticut
1:24:49
is asking the federal government for $17 million to build what they call Extreme extremely exciting trail from the New
1:24:56
York Border in Brewster for 6 miles of walking trails if I do my math right
1:25:01
that's 2 m833
1:25:08
33333 for every mile how many people a day is it predicted usage 50 100 150 out
1:25:16
of 15,000 that sounds unbalanced once the novelty wears off the numbers will
1:25:22
dwindle why are we on the rail B Trail bandwagon wagon copycatting other
1:25:27
municipalities build a walkway along the rail spur if you need let it be a path
1:25:33
who's going to maintain a trail with excess garbage vagrance crime snow and ice please be respectful of those
1:25:40
generational taxpaying residents who have lived along the train tracks for decades the idea of families riding
1:25:47
bicycles on Main Street is horrifying you can't even ride a car down Main
1:25:52
Street let alone a string of bicycles I cringe at the thought of bringing recreational bike riders onto Main
1:25:59
Street and Route 52 it's giving them a false sense of Safety and Security I see
1:26:04
people almost every day getting clipped on these streets more importantly Route 52 is only one of two dedicated Trucking
1:26:12
Transportation routes posted in our city and if I had to pick my battles I would
1:26:17
say let the dunk drive through pass through the that Interruption I'm sorry
1:26:23
through the P plan board process and keep the recreation bicycles off the streets thank you thank you very much um
1:26:30
the Miss Riley if you wanted to talk about the one e main rezoning this would
1:26:36
be the opportunity for you to do that and we would hear your comments later on in the meeting that won't
1:26:45
occur oh are you just wanting to listen R own
1:26:59
okay I I would I would think that um you could listen to the conversation and
1:27:04
learn what you can from it I don't think it would affect you so I would um think you're okay as you are if you discover
1:27:10
something there's a second opportunity for public comments but that will be after we've decided something all right
1:27:16
but I think you're okay I just to come then come up to this and just
1:27:23
tell us who your and even if it's to ask questions it's okay thank you I'm sorry haven't
1:27:29
done this before so I really appreciate your time really simp it's very simple it's just that um I don't know what the
1:27:36
implications are of going from zoning um from a light industrial to um Main
1:27:42
Street so so right now there are two or three um there are two retail units that
1:27:49
do have Beverages and things like that it's wonderful and other retail units does this mean that they could all
1:27:55
someday be bars or restaurants like I don't know I just I don't know what what what it means so I was hoping to to
1:28:01
learn about that and really I was hoping that other owners could have an opportunity to perhaps um weigh in or
1:28:09
just talk about it but we just we just didn't know about it so it's it's it's okay that's really it I just just don't
1:28:15
know what it means for kind of everything that's going on so so hang out your questions get answered very
1:28:21
shortly when we go through it and we'll make sure that we provide enough information for the audience to kind of
1:28:26
hear what we're doing and the reasons for it okay right and we're not passing anything tonight I think we're referring
1:28:32
it on is the next step is my understanding so there would be a later public hearing so even if something you
1:28:38
heard tonight or had further questions oh that's absolutely right I'm really sorry we're not making a final decision tonight so I'm sorry I didn't see the
1:28:45
word referring on the agenda so all we're doing in this meeting is voting to
1:28:51
refer it to two planning boards for imp they will have 30 days for input so
1:28:56
it'll be plenty of opportunity good thank you for pointing out the magic word
1:29:02
referring okay anyone else want to make a comment come on up tell us who you are what you want to where you

1:33:12
update Chris I know we talked about H Hudson River housing coming to talk to us I think it was related to 248 and now
1:33:18
I know we have the Adu plus1 program so didn't know if there was that if they were going to come to us sometime coming
1:33:24
soon if you had any any current details about that just how that program works as well um because they manage our
1:33:30
Workforce housing I just had some general just generally curious to learn more about it and I will pass it to Jeff
1:33:36
thanks Molly I'll keep it very short I have my office hours on Sunday March 16th 11 to1 at bang Square uh and I'm
1:33:43
sure somebody would say it but I'll just point out again that on the 9th this Sunday this Sunday um the fiscal Avenue
1:33:49
Concepts committee Community feedback meeting is taking place at industrial Arts between 2 and 5
1:33:55
over to you all right um I will remind folks once again that tomorrow is the
1:34:02
closing of public comments for the Hudson Highlands Fior Trail uh because we have been here a while I will mention
1:34:09
just very briefly from my public comments in support of the fiard trail I wrote about my role on the visitation
1:34:15
data committee and my agreement with the findings issued um that while the trail may bring an increase in some visitation
1:34:22
on some days the Trail proposes improvements to ensure that that impact is manageable and it's a far better
1:34:28
solution than what is happening today this is a very popular area for people to enjoy and they should have safe
1:34:34
access to the outdoors um I also mentioned that I see the for Fior Trail as an overall
1:34:40
positive for Beacon I have found the Fior Trail representatives to be transparent open to feedback and good
1:34:45
partners in their interactions with the city of Beacon and its community members I'm sure there will be plenty of
1:34:50
opportunities for um engagement as the weather warms up they were very active in Beacon here last year and I would
1:34:56
imagine the same will be true um so in closing my public comments I noted that
1:35:01
the Fior Trail is an opportunity for community members to enjoy expanded access to the riverfront in an
1:35:07
accessible way and brings proposals that enhance our existing Park infrastructure so I would encourage everybody um to
1:35:14
take the opportunity to submit their comments tomorrow is the deadline and you can find information on how to do so
1:35:20
at the fiard trails website thank than you thank you um I'll
1:35:26
keep going on the event train and say that this Saturday is the annual parade of green the parade kicks off at noon at
1:35:33
po Hill Park right across the street followed by as Jeff said on Saturday the
1:35:39
Fishkill Avenue Concepts committee meeting um at industrial Arts um with
1:35:45
everything happening this weekend I have rescheduled my open Office hours to the following weekend um so they will now be
1:35:51
also um same as Jeff on Sunday March 16th but mine will be from 4: to 6: at
1:35:58
um the tracks coffee at 1 East Main come talk to me about anything you'd like
1:36:03
including what's going on in your building just come downstairs um and uh
1:36:09
yeah looking forward to talking to anyone about whatever you want all right you gave all the dates
1:36:15
already so um just wanted to remind everybody about the workhouse housing
1:36:20
applications for below market rate units for Mid to moderate income households um
1:36:26
the information is on the city website and this program is through the Hudson River housing also I saw that the tree
1:36:35
purchase program is out there again I just wasn't sure where to find that on the
1:36:41
website and that's all I have um good evening most people have
1:36:47
already said what I was going to say but I would like to as Jeff and um pal we're
1:36:54
talking about the this Sunday as an opportunity for the public to participate in um um the decisions that
1:37:01
will be made on Fishkill Avenue those are going to be very very important for the future of Beacon that's a important
1:37:08
economic and Commercial Corridor so I hope that and this is the time for the
1:37:13
public to have their say in that matter so please come we hope to have a good turnout um it'll be very informational
1:37:19
thank you um I spoken enough uh plus my
1:37:25
colleagues put out the information that I would otherwise put out so um Chris if you got something I do um Molly I don't
1:37:33
know the answer to your question but Nick May um they were going to come and talk about 248 I know that got delayed
1:37:40
several times Nick do you have a date may I ask it was going to be March 10th
1:37:46
and I put a call in just to confirm that again but Ben had scheduled March 10th
1:37:51
okay um as Pam mentioned we are opening our annual tree purchase program we did
1:37:57
the inaugural year last year it was very successful we're trying to build on that this year um if you go to Beacon n.m
1:38:06
myrec.com you can find or if you simply um search Beacon Recreation backyard
1:38:13
trees you'll find it we'll be putting a button on our uh website soon and announcing it via social media this is a
1:38:20
program that basically buys trees at wholesale prices and delivers them to
1:38:25
homeowners so you end up saving almost half of the cost because we don't pay tax delivery or uh the retail price and
1:38:33
we have uh chosen with the tree committee a number of trees that we think they're all Native they would um
1:38:40
support pollinators and birds and wildlife and enhance the quality of life in the city um we are nearing Springs
1:38:48
begin and that means construction season is starting next Monday we will be uh
1:38:54
remobilizing for the Fishkill teller Avenue project uh we have extended the
1:38:59
sidewalk replacement on the North side or um the sitgo gas station side to go
1:39:06
from Blackburn Avenue all the way to um uh Mill Street so that we pick up that
1:39:13
last neighborhood you'll see them mobilizing next week we hope to have them completely finished by July and we
1:39:20
are also working with Central Hudson which is doing another round of pipeline gas pipeline upgrades in city streets
1:39:28
mostly on the east side of the creek uh they will be announcing to homeowners in
1:39:34
those are in the impacted areas um will receive notices and you will see denella
1:39:40
construction which is the entity doing it so again we'll be announcing that on our um on our social media and our
1:39:47
website as soon as we have the start date but it may be as early as next week and that's all I have thank
1:39:56
you okay so let's do we have three resolutions one referring two one
1:40:04
appointing and one approving so let's do the appointing the first one is uh an
1:40:09
appointment of Brian Murphy to the position of building inspector 2 can I
1:40:15
get a motion in a second motion second so um that's uh amber and Pam um she
1:40:23
should have did I get that right Molly should get it Amber Molly get it all out
1:40:29
yet no matter um and then Chris would you add anything on Brian Murphy I I
1:40:34
would just say Brian came to last week's workshop and met the council um his um
1:40:40
appointment is necessary because Bruce flower took a position in the town of pipy where he had worked for 18 years um
1:40:48
after being with us for 2 and A2 years uh we we now have that position open
1:40:53
Brian has uh quite a bit of experience he's been a building inspector in the village of Whoppers for uh 13 years had
1:41:01
a construction business before that we think he's a good fit for the department and if you approve tonight he would
1:41:08
start next week yeah um I wasn't able to attend the
1:41:14
meeting live but I appreciated listening back to um his presentation and his interview and it just stood out to me on
1:41:21
his resume that um he had been part of a comprehensive master plan committee I assume for the village of Wappingers um
1:41:28
but I appreciate that breadth of um experience that he
1:41:35
brings okay so you know we had Brian uh here at Workshop so absent any other
1:41:41
questions um let's call a vote on it so all in favor of appointing Brian Murphy to building inspector say I I I anyone
1:41:50
opposed okay the second one is a motion approving the lowp contributions which
1:41:57
is the length of service award program for volunteer firefighters who get the
1:42:02
equivalent of a small pension depending on the hours that they put in um can I
1:42:08
get a motion in a second for that motion second so that was Pam and Molly Chris will you uh add a little further if you
1:42:15
think sure um again we discussed this a workshop this is a program that the city set up many years ago to um help
1:42:23
compensate the the volunteers with a defined uh pension plan for every year
1:42:28
that they serve they get $20 a year um for for life up to $400 a month um each
1:42:36
year we have to certify who's in the program and who's earned what credits and as you know we have a declining
1:42:42
number of volunteers so there's not a lot of people that uh gain service this year uh but we still need to do this as
1:42:49
a um as a certification
1:42:56
all right as you could see from the the list there are a number who are receiving uh uh something from the
1:43:02
program but very few who are gaining um service credits toward it because we
1:43:07
don't have too many volunteers still active right um any other comments on this all right so it's something we have
1:43:14
to do each year all in favor of approving the uh lowp um contributions
1:43:20
say I I I anyone opposed okay that's the second one the third one
1:43:25
is I'm looking for a motion in a second to refer a zoning Change on East M
1:43:31
concerning East Main Street to the city of Beacon and The Duchess County planning boards motion second so that's
1:43:38
Amber and Molly and to clarify before I hand it over to Nick all this motion is
1:43:43
doing is referring the change proposal to those two boards and there will be a
1:43:48
public hearing at some point as well Nick will you tell us for the uh benefit
1:43:53
of the public what the proposed change is about I will mayor thank you the
1:43:59
public hearing is being scheduled for March 17th and will be considered by the planning board at its March 11th meeting
1:44:06
and as you mentioned this is also being sent to the County planning board for referral and comment so this is um a
1:44:13
local law that was prepared after the last Workshop discussion and in the
1:44:18
materials included in the agenda packet is a memorandum from the former building inspector February 5th that details his
1:44:25
thoughts as to the rationale as to why the zoning District the properties that one these Main Street are located in
1:44:32
should be rezoned from the light industrial district to the Central Main Street the CMS district there are about
1:44:40
25 properties so this rezoning would affect the retail and the residential
1:44:45
units within the one East Main Street property including the common elements um the change from Li to TMS
1:44:53
will result in some uses that are now permitted being prohibited and likewise some uses that are prohibited now being
1:44:59
permitted the best way to understand that is to take a look at the zoning
1:45:05
code there is the table of uses that sets forth in a column format those uses
1:45:10
that are permitted or prohibited within the CMS and the LI district for example
1:45:17
multif family dwelling units are now prohibited in the LI District but would
1:45:23
be permitted in the CMS district and the building inspector noted in his February
1:45:28
5th memo that the uses that were originally deemed to be artist live workspaces have Mor overtime into more
1:45:37
akin to mostly family units and making this zoning change from one District to
1:45:42
the other would legalize and formalize those uses to be consistent with um
1:45:47
what's actually the use is likewise there are some changes for a restaurant or coffe house which is not now
1:45:54
permitted would be permitted in the CMS district and there's a number of other
1:45:59
examples and I'll make sure that this zoning chart is included um the next
1:46:04
time this is for the council so you have that and we will also work with the uh
1:46:09
City administrator's office to get notices out to the individual residents who are the subject of the uh of the
1:46:15
zone change so this is merely changing or is changing from one zoning District
1:46:20
to the other from the light industrial to the CMS and you're just scheduling the public hearing and
1:46:28
referr okay a question I think we talked about this at Workshop but I just want to
1:46:34
refresh my memory so the folks that um own properties in one East Main would
1:46:40
they receive a letter of the public hearing yeah okay yes and then related
1:46:45
to that if for some reason either the county or our city planning board could not review this before the
1:46:53
March 17th public hearing we would delay that to a later date is that how the process works no our process is we would
1:47:01
open the public hearing and then not make a decision in all likely we would continue the public hearing until we
1:47:07
receive comments from um o board great thank you for
1:47:12
clarifying okay um just sorry just because I again
1:47:18
missed the workshop I did have um mostly one one question um Nick could you help
1:47:25
me understand the functional difference between an artist live workspace and the
1:47:31
multif family um unit in in the context of this condo um I'm trying to
1:47:39
understand how these units functionally moved away from being artist live
1:47:44
workspaces into being what we're now considering multif family units um and I
1:47:52
I could use some help understanding the definitions sure artist live workspace
1:47:58
is set forth in the code 223-14 point2 and has a number of
1:48:03
Standards about the minimum square footage um how the space is to be
1:48:08
utilized and I don't know the specifics um the building department would have to
1:48:14
explain more about how that is varied over time but I can certainly provide the council with that definition so you
1:48:20
have an understanding of it but the what the facts are the ground specifically with the units I cannot speak to that
1:48:25
but certainly we'll get some more details yeah I I broadly understand that
1:48:31
the I think the phrase that was used in in Workshop is that this ship has sailed
1:48:37
um in terms of the use of these units um but I would like to understand how how
1:48:43
that ship got out of the harbor in the first place so um the thing I would add and we can talk about this in Workshop
1:48:50
is that um when things were coming online there's some discretion that the building department has so I think we'll
1:48:56
discover the ship was sailing through that discretion right but when you you look at this goes to one of the things I
1:49:04
think we would I would like to work on which is that our uses are very specific
1:49:09
and there are different uses in different zones and I think they don't work for the reason that you're kind of
1:49:15
raising like what's the difference between a live work artist and a regular residence and I I think we should bro
1:49:22
Bren our definitions so that um a single definition of residential whether it
1:49:28
includes an office or a live work or whatever is considered the same general use and that way we wouldn't have that
1:49:34
distinction but again we don't have to deal with that tonight I'm just saying I would like to start having us look at it
1:49:39
because there's some issues of our specificity that we've had in there um
1:49:44
like for instance you know is the is it a if they grind coffee was it okay as a
1:49:50
Light Industry use if they didn't have too many seats was it okay as a Light Industry I'd like us to start moving
1:49:56
away from that it's not a tomorrow um topic but it's on the back of my list somewhere okay yeah I think my my other
1:50:05
two main questions were were answered through throughout the workshop that um
1:50:10
it it does make sense to me to let the Huds and VY Brewery continue to operate as it as it is and how um our Churchill
1:50:17
lot is not a parking lot but a government use and that's why it's okay that it's a parking lot
1:50:23
yep any other comments on this uh for before we vote to
1:50:28
refer hearing none all in favor referring this proposed change to our two planning boards say I I I anyone
1:50:36
