## Dutchess County Transportation Council Presentation on the Proposed Beacon-Hopewell Rail Trail Project [30:30-1:06:02]

### Overview
- Federally funded planning study on converting the abandoned Beacon-Hopewell rail line into a recreational trail
- 13-mile trail would connect Beacon waterfront and downtown to the Empire State Trail system 
- Study currently in Task 2 (analyzing conditions and developing trail design concepts)

### Key Findings

#### Current Conditions
- Rail line is owned by MTA/Metro North but has been rail-banked (preserved for potential future rail use)
- Majority of corridor is in good condition and suitable for trail development
- Six bridge structures need assessment and retrofitting for pedestrian use
- Seven major road crossings require safety improvements
- Some encroachment from adjacent properties observed
- No significant washouts within Beacon city limits
- Corridor has adequate drainage structures with some minor issues to address

#### Trail Design Options
1. Rail-to-Trail (recommended option):
   - Remove existing tracks and reuse corridor
   - Reuse existing bridges with modifications for pedestrian/emergency vehicle use
   - Minimal right-of-way acquisition needed
   - Lower cost and environmental impact

2. Rail-with-Trail (more challenging alternative):
   - Keep existing tracks in place
   - Require 25-foot offset from tracks
   - Need for new bridges, culvert extensions, and significant fill
   - Higher costs and environmental impacts, especially in narrow sections
   - Challenges with existing buildings and infrastructure

#### Road Crossings
- Major crossings within Beacon include Church Hill Street and East Main Street
- Potential treatments include rapid rectangular flashing beacons, raised pedestrian islands
- Opportunity to incorporate and protect the historic "dummy light" at East Main Street
- Minor crossings could be managed with signage and striping

#### Connections and Access
- Potential trailhead at Madam Brett Park
- Connection to Long Dock Park through existing trail system
- Multiple access points from road crossings 
- Coordination with Hudson Highlands Fjord Trail project

### Community Input
- Over 1,000 survey responses received with strong support for the trail
- Most requested amenities: restrooms, benches, waste receptacles, and wayfinding signage
- Expected primary uses: biking, walking, and connecting to other trails

### Concerns Raised
- Privacy for adjacent residents
- Maintenance responsibilities and costs
- Snow removal and seasonal use
- Integrating with existing infrastructure
- Land acquisition issues
- Potential cost of building the trail and feasibility 
- Parking and access points

### Next Steps
- Virtual public meeting scheduled for March 20th
- Draft report to be released in Spring 2025
- Second public meeting to follow after draft release
- Final report expected Summer 2025
- Phased construction approach likely for implementation
