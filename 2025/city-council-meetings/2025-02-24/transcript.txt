0:12
thank you Amber that's better good teamwork we can hear you now I didn't
0:19

0:27
everybody so as Amber has SU inly pointed out it's after 7 it's 7:01 can
0:33
you imagine so this is a workshop uh as almost all of you know workshops are one
0:39
where the council preps for its next formal meeting and we do the talking and you all don't generally um but welcome
0:47
for those who are here uh and then let's get started so our first item on the
0:57
agenda is accessory Department you're going to do a I will do a roll call yeah
1:03
so in person I uh see Jeff Amber the mayor Hammond George I see the city
1:09
administrator do we have anyone online Molly rhods is here hey Molly and
1:17
mayor Nick Ward Wills caning Bean City attorney hey Nick okay so um and also
1:22
city planner Natalie Quinton is on yep thanks Nick and Natalie Quinn from KC planning well that's good cuz you're
1:29
going to take on on the first topic with Nick which is the oh I'm sorry that's right so Paloma
1:36
is traveling and excused all right so that gives us our role and I said our
1:42
first uh item is accessory apartment regulations uh we're looking at some
1:47
amendments I don't know if Nick or Natalie which one of you is going to start up I can go ahead and get started um so
1:55
I believe council members have the memo in front of them but if not just let me know and I can kind of share my screen
2:01
as we walk through this um but as a reminder at the January 27th meeting or
2:07
Workshop meeting of the council um we continued the discussion that we've been having um regarding potential zoning
2:14
changes aimed at improving housing availability and affordability in the city of Beacon and where we landed at
2:21
the end of that last conversation is I think uh potential updates to adus was
2:26
identified as a priority and kind of a loow hanging fruit since we have regulations on the books um and there
2:32
might be minor tweaks that we could make to this to both make the process easier and more affordable for Beacon residents
2:38
and also complement the plus one ad program that the city um was recently uh
2:45
approved their applic had their application approved by New York State homes and Community Renewal um so with that we prepared a
2:53
memo that is kind of a a decision tree it just what it does is basically walk us through the various regulations that
3:00
are currently um in the code for the city of Beacon to consider where we may
3:05
want to amend some of those uh to make the process uh more user friendly and
3:11
and easier to utilize for properties of the city so I can walk through that I
3:16
think the one other thing you had in your packet I want to point your attention to uh we did have a memo from
3:21
Bruce flower uh building inspector um just the end of January before he left
3:27
uh giving us kind of an accounting of of uh fees that are associated with going
3:33
through the approval process both the planning Board review as well as uh building permit review uh for adus and
3:40
then also kind of an accounting of the number of units that we've seen go through that process over the past two
3:47
years um which is a a pretty small number of just four four adus um since
3:53
2022 that that he had in his records I'm sure there's more before that but that was the time frame he looked at
4:00
um so with that I guess if anyone has any questions I can take those otherwise we'll just jump into the decision tree
4:06
memo and start making our way through um through those questions those
4:13
prompts okay okay uh so I think it's important to kind of remind as we go
4:19
through these I think it's good to set the tone of kind of restating the intent as it's codified uh for accessory
4:25
apartments and why the city adopted those in the first place so I'll just read real quick quickly for the code um
4:31
it is the purpose and intent of allowing accessory apartments on all existing single family properties in all
4:38
residents districts and the transitional District to provide the opportunity and encouragement for the development of
4:44
small rental housing units designed to meet the special housing needs of single
4:49
persons couples and other small households the young the elderly person
4:54
the elderly persons of low and moderate income and relatives of families presly
5:00
living in Beacon that's a very long sentence that was all one sentence uh it is further purpose and intent this
5:07
provision to allow the more efficient use of City's existing stock of dwellings and accessory buildings to
5:12
provide economic supp support for present residents uh resident families of limited income and to otherwise help
5:19
to protect and preserve property values so I think you know summarizing that kind of the intent is the provision of
5:25
housing uh for smaller household units as well as uh High best kind of utilization of existing land and keeping
5:32
the footprint um of development kind of contained to already developed
5:37
areas so the first question um is it notes that accessory apartments are
5:43
currently permitted in all R1 Rd and T districts and the question posed is
5:49
whether or not the city would want to expand the districts where adus are permitted uh for example you know one
5:56
family attached and semi detached structures are also permitted pered in the linkage district and the uh the fish
6:02
kill Creek District uh so the question is posed whether the city would want to permit accessory apartments on single
6:09
family lots in those districts as well um and then I guess the other question
6:14
not posed here is whether the city would want to expand to other districts Beyond those so that's that's the first
6:20
question I don't know if council members have thoughts on that yes so I'll start on that one um so
6:27
I um believe in um opening up the adus
6:33
and so my general view would be to say to permit it everywhere with some exceptions and so um I guess I'd be
6:42
interested to know do is it permitted when the single when the single family
6:47
the residential structure is a townhouse or a semi-attached or a two
6:55
family or is it only for a one an R1 that it would be permitted for a single family structure don't
7:02
worry about the zoning let's worry about the structure for a moment right because I think I'm okay saying if it's an
7:09
attached project for instance like um Sycamore where that one you'd say well
7:17
those are already pretty tight and dense and you may not want an Adu in the middle of a development like
7:23
sycore um if you have an existing two family you might say on a on a lot you
7:29
might say well that already has two it doesn't need an Adu but I would think that everywhere that there's a single
7:36
family structure um that I'd be okay with an Adu and I'm just putting out
7:41
ideas because I like to discuss I'm not sure I fully form My Views but let's start there if that's
7:48
okay so you're saying everywhere on every lot with a a detached single
7:54
family home cor correct that the that the detached single family home and
7:59
whatever accessory structures could support an Adu but if the residential
8:05
structures are already at least two on the lot then you'd say no to that yeah
8:12
that's kind of similar to um what the city of Kingston has done right they don't really specify what districts adus
8:19
are permitted in uh but they say they're permitted on all single family residents
8:24
uh Lots right um so you kind of if there's an existing single family that
8:30
maybe is existing non-conforming in some zoning District um you could still do it
8:36
there it's right as long as the primary use of the lot currently is single family oh okay yeah that's what I'm
8:43
thinking yeah I think that makes sense as well um I guess my question is was
8:48
there does anyone remember the reasoning behind not having it in the L and the FCD districts U when we drafted this
8:57
originally or can you Natalie can you think of any reason why we
9:02
shouldn't so if I recall if I can help those districts were assumed to be um
9:08
multif family structures um but that doesn't mean that there isn't a single family home a single family structure in
9:16
those zones and this is saying if there is a single family structure in those zones that would be permitted in that
9:23
structure yeah that makes a lot of sense to me it makes a lot of sense everybody good yep okay so it's
9:30
slightly different than what we've been thinking right but I I think it's the right approach and apparently Kingston's done the same thing okay
9:38
cool okay uh second question is uh regarding whether the city is satisfied
9:43
with the requirement that the owner of a single family home lot must reside in either the primary or the accessory unit
9:50
on said lot right so one of the two units has to be occupied uh by the owner
9:57
of that of that lot this prevents um you know landlord situations where it's a
10:04
non non-owner occupied unit maybe they are renting the main primary structure
10:09
and then also creating an Adu to rent that as well um so I think again just
10:15
kind of background here I think traditionally many many communities Beacon is definitely not the only one that has limited limited um adus of
10:23
properties with with the owner with the owner rose ziding on site I think we've started to
10:30
see some communities chip away that slightly right just because mostly
10:35
focusing more on trying to provide as much rental housing as possible right that's kind of
10:41
one of the goals stated in the intent of the code um is to provide res rental
10:47
housing um and that can be provided I think whether the owner resides on site
10:52
or not but I think there's obviously many um who still push for that retention of that regulation to ensure
10:59
that kind of the single family homeowner um nature of the neighborhood kind of
11:05
Remains the Same so I guess the question is whether the council would want to consider removing that requirement for
11:12
owner occupancy um in one of the units right now I do struggle with this being
11:17
a requirement like just kind of thinking about this you know I I certainly don't think we want to permit short-term
11:23
rentals here so I'm not going there at all and I do think that it's important to have
11:30
a to think about our stock of home ownership versus rental it feels like we have kind of a lot of rentals I don't I
11:37
don't know if that's the case I don't know that we have the data to really prove that um but I feel like at the end
11:43
of the day I'm not sure I really care if they're rentals or owned and I'm not
11:48
sure why I would yeah I can tell you historically why we did it and Chris you were around for this um we were we were
11:56
eliminating the ability to convert single family homes to multif family in certain sections of town because it was
12:03
basically uh they were turning into not just twos but fours and fives and they were in very narrow streets and so one
12:10
of the tradeoffs was to permit the accessory uh unit accessory apartment is
12:16
what we called it we call it accessory apartment accessory apartment in the code which we did almost 30 years ago
12:23
and we required owner occupied and we were thinking you know we wanted some a senior to be able to stay in their house
12:29
things like that I'm okay requiring it I think the difference would be whether
12:36
you know I I I hear you Amber it's not necessary it might Pro provide for a better
12:42
neighborhood um but that's I think the only issue I can see yeah and I feel like that argument
12:49
is kind kind of saying that like rent don't provide a stable neighborhood and
12:55
I don't I don't think that's necessarily the message I don't know just feel like this one I I I don't know that it really
13:03
matters to me I'm pretty strong that I feel like it should be owner occupied and even just looking back at the stated
13:09
intent of accessory apartment it's to provide economic support for PR present
13:14
resident families of limited income so I mean the whole intent is owner occupied
13:20
yeah I do worry about the trend of like you know people just buying something up and putting two rental units on to make
13:28
a profit so again I'm perfectly comfortable with this either either way there are a lot of people who've done
13:34
that and who don't live in Beacon so and it is a has been a concern of mine yeah I agree as well I think
13:42
um although adding to the housing stock and Rental availability is an important
13:47
thing I don't think it's a priority in terms of the intent of this law right um so and I believe that it should be uh
13:54
designed primarily for existing uh homeowners for to make their they're
14:00
make it more affordable for them so I agree as well I lean towards that as well but curious if it's possible to
14:07
have a optional pathway kind like a special use permit is there an application process where somebody could
14:13
apply it's not an as of right they can't just do it without uh going through a process where
14:18
there'd be some evaluation about the applicant as a potential off-site
14:26
landlord we could do that um you you've actually had that you had a variance
14:31
come to the zba of somebody who bought a single family home and then wanted to build an Adu and I don't think they got
14:38
the variance I don't recall the outcome but I remember that coming before the board I mean it might have been the case
14:44
where neighbors expressed concern I mean I'm not saying anything on this particular case but it would be the
14:50
process where you had to get the variance and there would be some input that people could have and have some
14:55
control over their neighborhood in a broader way which is one of the issues about ad to use is the neighborhood
15:02
character so if we wanted and help me out Nick if we wanted to could we
15:09
specify that a variance to the owner occupancy has a lower has the use VAR
15:18
has the area variance standard in zba as opposed to the use variant standard
15:24
could we do that we do not have the authority to do that no that's what I thought so what I was suggesting was uh
15:31
a an area variance is an easier standard to get a variance on than a use and this is a use right we're going from a one to
15:37
a 1 plus an Adu I was wondering if we could specify a lesser uh standard and
15:43
apparently we can't um is there another approach we could take to kind of permit
15:48
it where it seems appropriate that someone makes a decision so it wouldn't be a variance it
15:54
would be a planning board or something else yeah I think to F's recommendation
16:00
that would be maybe making it a special permit use with additional kind of considerations right so it would go to
16:05
the planning board still it wouldn't necessarily it's not not permitted um
16:10
but Nick I'll let you weigh in on that I don't know if that's language we could add that would just make it specially permitted and not require a use variance
16:17
right it's it's it's saying that it's more likely than not to be granted so long as they can meet certain criteria
16:22
that you set forth for the issuance of the special use permit so it's not it's a it's a lower
16:29
standard because it's deemed permitted and they just need to check a couple of
16:34
boxes how would the decisions be made you know what kind of restrictions could we put on that and you know is well
16:42
parking um density in the neighborhood perhaps things of that nature we'd have to come up with some criteria that could
16:48
be objectively applied uniformally across the
16:54
districts so let me make a suggestion I I I current just my own current views I
16:59
would lean against removing the owner occupied restriction now and then we could view it in a couple of years and
17:06
see what we think is going on yeah I don't know if that's okay with everyone but that would be another option I'm
17:12
fine with that the the one question and Nick this would probably be to you um
17:17
for owner occupied excuse me if it was for um what some of the older people do
17:25
like have a uh life estate on their house where Maybe the children are the
17:30
owners but they can live in it would that be still consider considered owner
17:36
occupied I I to pull up a definition I believe we did carve out trust and sort of other estate planning issues as being
17:44
counted as owner occupancy but I can look at that okay because they think that would be important to make
17:49
sure that would be allowed and I wasn't even thinking it just like a it's just
17:55
in the name of a trust um that maybe the trustees or the grantor
18:00
would have to be the um owners owner occupied no I'll take a look at that
18:07
while we're on this see if I can get back to on that good I mean I'm generally interested in input the data that's not
18:15
necessarily reflected it's good to see the data that's in that memo from Bruce but um you know I'm surprised to see
18:20
only four approved data use but I'm curious and challenging I understand unless we set up a formal process about
18:27
people who've asked about applied for you know a certain threshold not just minimum just like had a casual
18:33
conversation but input like do we are we getting requests from people in the different zoning areas are we getting
18:39
requests for rental units that they're just not proceeding just to just to gauge the levels of Interest as we go
18:45
forward in time so I mean I'll tell you anecdotally I've spoken to at least three people that have been interested
18:51
in applying for adus and have either like not done it because they weren't really sure what the rules were or was
18:58
the cost C prohibitive or they like called the building department and then it was confusing and um we kind of like waiting
19:06
to see if there's a a path forward that makes it not as difficult so yeah i'
19:12
I've had three people in the last week uh reach out to me regarding this plus one program as well so yeah yeah I'm
19:21
just curious of going from anecdotal to formally understanding the demand and the character of the demand well you're
19:27
the person who would be able B to provide us anecdotal judgment is listening to this to your comments right
19:33
now assuming that that we appoint the person so that's good
19:39
um okay so this is a really good conversation let's keep going because we're digging right at the issues that
19:46
affect you know both um cost and neighborhood and other things you want to keep going Natalie y absolutely uh so
19:54
third question on the memo is um I guess we can skip this one for now but just keep it in mind for if we return to this
20:01
conversation is based on the responses above if any property owner can build an accessory apartment right regardless of
20:07
owner occupied does the city want to set restrictions so that's kind of what we were going through um and we can kind of
20:12
continue to note right now I think I have traffic and kind of neighborhood character um we could kind of build what
20:18
those would be so jumping down to number four um accessory apartments are currently regulated by a minimum square
20:24
foot requirement of 200 square ft um does the city fill requirement is necessary it should be noted that New
20:31
York State Building Code also regulates the minimum size of dwelling units so
20:36
you know I I included this one because basically this letter goes through every stipulation right so we just have a chance to talk about everything that's
20:42
in the code and and discuss it um and this was one I think to to maybe Amber's
20:48
point about just removing information that's not necessary or to try and make it as clear and succinct as possible um
20:55
I don't know if this requirement is necessary again I'll stop citing city of Kingston but kind of they removed it
21:01
just because there's other there's other aspects that control the minimum size of a dwelling unit when you're going for a
21:07
building permit so whether or not we want to keep 200 square F feet in here um in the city's code and this would
21:13
only be relevant for a one person living unit uh New York state law requires a
21:19
minimum of 150 square feet of Total Living Space for one occupant and then
21:25
it's an additional 100 additional square feet for each subsequent occupant so you
21:31
just you'd be knocking 50 off for a studio apartment you're saying if we left this topic blank New York State
21:39
lawol goes to New York State yeah you're just a little above New York State I think it should just be what the New
21:44
York state code is because if that code then changes we don't have to change
21:49
ours and I think the state building codes have have historically kind of been our foundational component
21:57
yeah good with that yep that sounds right yeah okay um number five is a question
22:06
regarding whether the city is satisfied with the maximum uh right now there's a maximum 1,000 foot requirement for
22:12
accessory department so you can't go over 1,000 square fet um but as the code stands the planning board does have the
22:19
authority to permit larger apartments in an existing uh accessory building that
22:25
is larger than 1,000 sare ft right so if you have an existing building that is larger and you want to reutilize that uh
22:31
the planning board has the ability to consider that um as long as it's been
22:36
around for more than 5 years you didn't just build a very big garage uh and then come back and then try to apply for a
22:43
building permit for that garage right um it's kind of an existing structure so there is some authority to go over that
22:50
um that number again I don't know how often this would be a question for the building department how often this uh
22:57
stipulation gets questioned um I find that the few applications that have come before the
23:03
planning board are usually on the smaller side I haven't necessarily seen someone come up against this threshold
23:08
but it's a question worth considering not directly related to this
23:15
but tangentially related to it is the the size of the of adus are that you
23:21
could put on your property determined by a percentage of what the existing primary structure is um it ranges from
23:28
40 to 40% to 50% um and I'm wondering if that if we
23:34
want to reconsider eliminating that um I just don't understand why it's
23:39
there in the first place well I I think again historically I think we were trying to make the
23:45
accessory apartment this is the 30y year ago law um one bigger one smaller and it
23:51
was okay if the owner lived in the smaller one and rent it out the bigger one but the theory was oh we don't want
23:57
it to be a two family I I don't know if that's relevant and I think you're raising that question yeah
24:03
I think because like uh you know if we go back to the affordability question um
24:08
is what if someone has a a small house on their property and the property is
24:13
big enough with setbacks Etc and they want to build a bigger Adu and rent out the smaller unit um so I just don't so I
24:21
think we should consider eliminating that that percentage I think came out of your code at some point Nick can you
24:28
speak speak to that I'm I'm looking at our accessory apartment section 223
24:35
241 y I have that up and I don't see that it has the minimum square footage
24:42
but I don't see that it has at least in this part of the code the breakdown of
24:47
Well it can't be more than 30 or 40 or 45 doesn't say that no it's just that's
24:54
attachment three it's in the table that's attached to my memo okay it's in the table thank you buildings on
25:00
residential lots that's where it comes in so it's not stated in the the table thank so George I think
25:07
what you where you were going was you would not only just pull all the maximum items right the thousand and the 40%
25:14
item y y I'm okay with that and again it doesn't mean that they'll become bigger most of them won't
25:21
yeah but it's just one less restriction in case we get it wrong right just curious by the conversation
25:28
we had about square footage per person is there a maximum
25:35
occupancy no not of the code but again I believe that's defined by New York state code that would set fourth occupancy per
25:41
square footage right so it's in the state sorry Nick
25:47
it's a you're a little muffled are you saying it's in the state code correct the New York State Building
25:52
Code would provide how many people can occupy a unit based upon its square footage okay
26:01
in the code that I think would um would in some ways regulate like how big how
26:06
much building you can have on your site right there is a maximum percent building coverage uh for zoning
26:12
districts uh The Only Thing Worth keeping in mind there I think is that the linkage District in the FCD which we
26:19
just decided you could have a single family lot in there and they could have an Adu um those are the only two
26:26
districts without this maximum % building coverage but for example all the residential lots um in the tea
26:33
District uh where ex apartments are currently permitted they are also
26:39
regulated by the amount of of land that can be covered per lot right so you are
26:44
going to regulate the footprints of both your primary structure and your accessory structure in some way through that requirement as
26:55
well yeah thanks for calling that out Natalie when the idea of both I'm I'm fine with getting rid of the percentage
27:01
but doing that in conjunction with also getting rid of the maximum size I do
27:07
then have questions about are we ESS essentially getting around our own subdivision laws when you subdivide a
27:14
larger lot because you can fit two full-size houses on them and so I want to make sure that we're not
27:20
inadvertently setting if we want to do that we should do that probably not through Adu regulations so that's kind
27:26
of the concern that I have in my head I'm not saying that 1,000 ft is the right maximum size but if we're talking
27:33
about adus I think that has a thought in people's minds about what that means and I don't want to inadvertently set it up
27:39
to be something else we've certainly seen more and more development too go with people are maximizing the maximum
27:45
amount of house they can get on the lot and I think I would want to be cautious about um increasing that throughout our
27:54
community Kingston also has 1,000 square feet and it has to be less than 50% of
28:00
the square footage of the primary unit so I can give you another option
28:05
that may work too another one might be that if the the dwelling the accessor
28:11
the Adu is say bigger than the existing structure has to go to site
28:18
plan other words then you leave it to the planning board and you give them some discretion right and it could be
28:23
that it makes sense if it's a really big lot or for whatever reason but it also could mean it doesn't make sense
28:29
somewhere else um we could give discretion to the you know the the um
28:35
head of the building department but maybe this is one of the ones you'd say goes to site plan over a certain
28:44
size yeah kind of I think that makes sense would whatever we decide tonight will this go before the planning board
28:50
for them to review so the next steps would be that n and our office would prepare a local law you would Workshop
28:57
that one more time once you're satisfied you would then introduce the local law in refer to the zoning the planning
29:02
board and made County for review comment Nick we're having trouble with your mic and it's not on our end because we can
29:09
hear Molly clearly okay I apologize then I did my
29:14
sound check go back from your mic you're you're too close to your mic I think
29:19
that's what's happening okay is this any better much it is huh okay so the local law would be
29:28
drafted and reviewed at your next Workshop if you're satisfied with a local law you would introduce it and
29:34
then you would schedule a public hearing and refer to the two planning boards County and City for review and comment
29:40
now don't move because you're in the perfect spot for your Acoustics thank
29:47
you yeah you know I I hear that there there could be some issues with that this and so rather than legislate it
29:54
maybe we again allow discretion and let people look at it that site
30:00
specific now again the planning work might tell us you're not telling us enough to make a decision but we'll kind
30:06
of learn if that's where we're heading and we'll we'll adjust is that all right yeah
30:12
okay okay uh followup question uh number six is does the city want to maintain
30:18
the requirement of one parking space per ex accessory apartment as the code
30:24
stands the planning board does have the ability to wave um all parking requirements for an accessory apartment
30:30
when deemed appropriate by the
30:35
board I think I would consider keeping that as it is so long as there is an outlet and a possible you know
30:42
opportunity to wave the requirements um after review could the building inspector wave the requirement Natalie
30:49
um some of these don't go to the planning board like does does in the
30:54
case if say you're developing an apartment in in in the envelope of the
30:59
house you're not changing anything on the outside would this have to go to the planning board then for the to not have
31:07
a separate parking space I think it would I'll I'll punt to Nick I think it
31:13
would just because there's no language in there giving that authority to the to the building inspector um so I think he
31:21
would either send them to the zba or that I guess zba to ask for a variance or the planning board to ask for the
31:26
waiver correct unless there was some criteria in the code that set for what
31:32
standard the building inspector would be deemed to have authority to wave the
31:37
parking requirements I don't know if it's one size fits all so if it's more discretionary then it would have to go
31:42
to the planning boorder of the zba well I mean I want you to think further down in your questions you're asking about
31:49
whether these shouldn't go to the planning board anymore and should just go to the building inspector so maybe
31:54
you revisit this about whether the building in ector has this Authority once you determine that question they're
32:02
kind of I would put the one before the other maybe and I guess like to clarify
32:08
this because I I I would be more in favor of not worrying about the parking
32:14
requirement um so if I could ask a clarifying question if somebody says well the
32:21
street that I live on is a public Street and so thus there is parking does that fulfill the parking requirement
32:29
so you have to have the space see where I get kind of wrapped up on this is like there's nothing that says that my I
32:36
can't have five cars in my one car driveway and park all four of them on the public street so why is this a
32:44
requirement cuz we got to get them off in the
32:50
snow yeah I think right now as the code reads it it does require that you have it on your site so you know that is a
32:57
and then often what we see you know I've seen a few you know often for these single
33:03
family homes they'll have like a l a large driveway or something like that right where it's theoretically you could
33:08
probably fit three or four cars they'll just have to have their engineer kind of or whoever is preparing the plans for
33:14
the site plan kind of show the dimensions of stalls then on their on their driveway to show that they can fit
33:20
the required number of cars but CU Amber I I I hear you just because you have to
33:26
provide the space on your site does not mean that that's where the tenant or you as the primary homeowner
33:33
have to park all your cars is is the current requirement in
33:38
the code um for a single family one and then if there's an Adu that would be
33:44
another one that's a good question um let me pull I believe I
33:50
think that's what we did because if the limit is two
33:58
right because I think we when we redid parking I think we left one in for a single
34:03
family and so if we're saying an if an accessory unit would take a would require a second
34:09
one maybe one approach would be that if in the Judgment of the building
34:14
inspector the site doesn't have two um then they could refer it to the
34:21
planning board to see if they could wave it but otherwise if in their judgment there's two they're done
34:28
would that work again that doesn't answer your question right I guess I I
34:34
just I think having to go if you have to go to the planning board for only this to me that is so silly all right so the
34:41
alternative is yours which is how about one and not another one right just the one whatever the requirement is for a
34:47
single family what do others think where we
34:53
play I just think if and I agree to some extent but I just think if you imagine that this is wildly successful and
34:59
everyone is doing adus um and what kind of impact that might have on street parking in certain
35:07
areas um so I think we kind of have to think of it of a lot of people doing
35:12
this and then is it a problem that everybody's parking on the street maybe not um but in some areas it might might
35:19
be a problem yeah I think unfortunately the situation unfortunately unfortunately um
35:26
however you look at it I think the situation that we have seen with many communities is that you we are not seeing the uptake of adus as was maybe
35:34
once thought when these regulations were originally developed I think there was a you know a thought that it would be
35:40
hugely popular and you could build one on there' be one on every lot or every other lot and you'd see them all over
35:46
blocks and to some neighborhoods that really scared the neighbors I think um and I think why you're seeing kind of in
35:52
the second third generation of accessory departments or Adu regulations a lot of municipalities trying to make it easier
35:58
and easier is we're finding that it's both just very costly and prohibitive to
36:04
build these adus so you know looking at Bruce's numbers right the city of Beacon has seen four in the past two years I
36:11
was talking with the um housing planner in Kingston they're also doing whatever
36:16
they can to try and incentivize as many adus as possible right because they're just not seeing I think they have maybe
36:22
four um none built yet but four proposals that they've seen in the last last year with them permitting it
36:29
everywhere and having a zero parking requirement um so you know I do hear
36:35
because I think yes if it does really pick up Trend and it somehow gets much more affordable to build these and we
36:41
start seeing them then you do see that doubling of um of parking
36:48
needs unfortunately unfortunately for housing production we just haven't seen that Trend with Adu
36:53
development but it's something we could consider later down if we if we asked for nothing and we realized two years
37:01
down the road we could change it
37:07
yeah so are you proposing something me yeah uh yes I agree with uh
37:13
leave eliminate the required one parking space for the Adu for the Adu and so the
37:20
single family still has one correct but it wouldn't require an additional one correct right is everybody okay with
37:26
that as our starting point that we revisit yes I would add I would only add to that that if if they're going to be
37:33
above a certain size and we're sending it to the planning board the version that we talked about before they should
37:38
also consider the parking requirements for that larger one yeah that makes sense point I think that's a good call
37:45
yeah I'm okay with that because yeah if it's over a certain size and it's going to the planning board for that reason
37:51
then yeah I think that's a a legitimate ask and it's also going to project
37:58
that's expensive enough where you know The Upfront cost will get will get
38:03
passed you know through right CU it's a relatively Big Unit it's going to rent for something
38:09
okay I think the only thing I I also want to state with that is since we're retaining the owner the owner occupancy
38:15
requirement right this person is going to be living on this street and in on this block right and having to share
38:22
this the the um amount of parking that is available either on street or on their site with their tenant so I I
38:29
think now that we are still retaining the owner occupancy requirement I think that does help that should help people
38:35
feel a little bit more comfortable that people are going to be self-managing or regulating in some way too because this
38:41
is this is their street right but they live on yeah good point
38:47
okay okay um just three more so number seven is um are the minimum setback
38:52
requirements for accessing buildings which are listed um in the attachment 3
38:58
which I included as part of my memo um are these appropriate for accessory apartments and again these apply
39:04
to all accessory buildings on residential lots so it could you know just keep it keep that in mind that
39:10
these could be uh sheds and garages and other things um I did want to make a
39:16
note that existing non-complying accessory structures uh are permitted to
39:21
be utilized for accessory Apartments without a variance from the zba so we did stipulate that in the code um as
39:27
long as the structure is not being further enlarged or whatever the non-compliance issue is if it's height
39:33
or whatever um is not being increased so there is there is a little
39:38
bit of a release valve there right that um I believe based on this language that would still fall to the planning board
39:46
or maybe I guess that could uh Nick maybe you can weigh on this I guess it would be if it's something that's
39:51
subject to building permanent approval the building inspector could could deem
39:57
that's right is not is not expanding right so it could be planning board depending who's reviewing it planning
40:03
board or building inspector um could say okay this building is non-complying but it's not being increased uh therefore
40:10
they don't require variance correct it would be the building spect determination at that point okay so what
40:15
this would really apply to then would just be if someone is building a new structure if they're doing a detached
40:21
Adu or if they're doing um maybe an addition to the existing primary
40:26
structure um that they would have to meet these set setback requirements
40:33
okay I think I struggled with this the when we were talking about this at the end of I think the 2021 term before the
40:41
changes in 2022 um and I just have a hard
40:48
time like let's take just for example the the first row here r110 if somebody is required to have a
40:55
minimum of a 50 yard rear and 50 yard
41:01
side does that then totally Prelude them from having a unit you know what I mean like I I can't
41:08
quite figure out the the math on it I just did the math okay um so uh I did it
41:15
with an r140 but but let's do it with the r120 r120 is basically it's 4,000 ft
41:22
per acre per acre right so it's 40,000 ft is 300 by 400 okay that's that gives
41:29
you 120,000 if you take away 50 ft 50 yards right no okay got yeah yeah yeah
41:36
got it got it these are all feet but if you take away 50 ft all the way around I
41:41
I think I just did the calculation you you lose half the lot I don't think it can't be that much let me just try to do
41:48
the math again it's 100 time 40 anyway so that's my struggle with the with the setbacks is I can't quite figure out
41:55
what that actually leaves people to work with yeah I think I think the
42:01
setbacks for the larger properties don't make sense okay and I I think we should
42:06
revisit those I don't think we have to decide them tonight but someone ought to do the calculation that Amber is asking
42:12
which is if you were to take away the setback how much is left right I can
42:17
definitely do that I can do little diagrams for each of these to kind of show like if you had a square shaped lot right that fits within that lot
42:24
requirement what would that do and then the other ation I think we just be thinking about let's look at that let's
42:30
start there with the with a you know a traditional shaped lot and then just
42:35
think about some examples of where you get irregular shape Lots we can that
42:41
would be super helpful so I feel like I I can't have an opinion on this right now because I like can't visualize it so
42:48
I I can do the math in PL in plain English without any any pencils you got a 300X 400t lot she's going to draw it
42:56
out right you take away 50 on the 400 that leaves 300 because you take away 50 on either side on the 300 you take away
43:03
50 on either side that leaves 200 so what's left in the middle is a 200 by 300 that's 60,000 Square ft that's half
43:11
of the 120,000 so the 50 Foot setback in an r120 has taken out 50% of the
43:18
building lot and they already have a building on the lot yeah and that seems like it's too much yeah well while we
43:25
talking about that I think we should also look at the ones with the minimal setback of 5 ft which means that someone
43:30
could build a a um a building 10 ft from your window um so I think we should look at
43:38
that as well yeah so so I think these are worth revisiting right yeah yeah and
43:43
I think the the visualization will be very helpful at least for me Natalie but this this also includes for sheds right
43:51
not just adus I mean I could see the Adu a shed being closer but yeah but it's
43:58
not a person but not an Adu not a window looking yeah right
44:04
yeah so I I think we have a little bit of work on this piece right so Natalie
44:09
can you help us kind of visualize this yep we'll do absolutely um so moving on
44:15
to the next question this is the one that Chris started discussing so um does the city wish to further streamline the
44:21
approval process for accessory Apartments so right now the city building inspector currently has the
44:27
authority to issue permits for accessory apartments that are entirely contained within an existing family home if all
44:34
other Provisions are met um any apartment accessory apartment requiring
44:40
any kind of exterior addition uh conversion of existing accessory
44:45
buildings um or new accessory buildings require or new accessory buildings all that requires site plan approval from
44:51
the planning board um so my question there is should any of these typologies kind of be added uh to the list of types
44:59
of accessory apartments that are permitted by the building inspector but we let's start there if
45:05
there's and then I go and say if any of them do move to building inspector are there kind of additional um
45:13
additional stipulations or restrictions that we would want to place on those I I
45:18
would want to see more move to the authority of the building inspector and you know I think about
45:26
this in the way that like if you're doing renovations on your home like that's a building inspector
45:32
approval I think they have the the knowledge and the ability to say whether something meets the provisions and and I
45:41
think then if Provisions are not met you can go to the planning board but if we enact these changes that we're talking
45:46
about and all of the provisions are met I I feel like I would be comfortable
45:52
with those at the building inspector for anything that is outside of the provisions then sure maybe that needs to
45:59
go to planning board yeah that second category I could
46:04
see us easing up that's the direction that Amber is going and it could be some criteria like if it's an accessory
46:12
building meaning a garage or something that you're building out if it's nowhere near another
46:19
house why need a site plan if it is near another house then you might because you
46:25
know maybe it's too close close to that other home in the next lot over or whatever so maybe there's some criteria
46:32
we could establish that we backs yeah like setbacks we have to design those right but it's not only setbacks it's
46:39
setbacks and the existence of another home in that close into that view right
46:46
um and maybe there's maybe that's discretion of the building department maybe we could write it I'm not sure
46:53
right what what kind of things would trigger um um neighbor
46:59
notification planning board I think that would be the only so only things that go to the planning board so I'm just
47:05
wondering if suddenly people might get there might be buildings going up and they didn't know anything about it and
47:11
they have no say in the in the matter that that wouldn't be unlike a
47:16
single family home being constructed though right if you're not going for a site plan I mean if you have a lot you
47:22
already have your um your your lot lines where they need to be you could just
47:28
build a house with a building permit so we're I mean it's it's kind of like
47:34
you're using one standard for one and no I agree that's
47:40
true and that's not to argue what the answer is I don't know what the answer is yeah I mean I think I think
47:47
fundamentally I would like to see more things go to the planning the the building inspector it might be helpful
47:54
to get that person's in put whomever that may
47:59
be and you know maybe this is one that we might have to come back to as we get
48:05
through the setbacks and some of the other specifics of determining like which of the typologies really should go
48:11
to planning board and which are okay for building inspector sign off Nick would
48:17
it be legal to have certain certain conditions that if they
48:23
are present they trigger the possibility of the building inspector referring it
48:29
or requiring it to go to planning board for instance if you have another home in close proximity or you know the
48:37
building is a brand new building that wasn't on the site you know if we Define
48:44
in the code what is the triggering point then it's something that's mandatory in the building spectors not in the middle
48:50
and trying to exercise that discretion then yes we can build that into the code okay
48:57
so so this sounds like the second area that we're going to have another go at because it's connected to um um setbacks
49:06
right in in my head it is I feel like it's connected to what we end up saying
49:12
we kind of allowing as of right and then is there anything in that that we feel like okay these circumstances should go
49:18
to planning
49:24
board yeah even if there was no outside changes other than you know
49:29
window or something but if there was nothing changing of the walls it could go to the building
49:37
inspector but I guess the minute you start adding an addition well that's already the case
49:43
Pam okay yeah so the only reason it would go to the planning board is you're
49:49
expanding the unit you're converting another like a garage that's
49:54
disconnected or detached from the house or you're building a new structure yeah the garage would need to
50:02
go to the planning board need to go to planning board unless the the one thing that we we changed not so long ago but a
50:09
year ago maybe a year and a half ago is that if it's within the envelope of the existing building you don't have to of
50:15
the primary residence but any ancillary structure so you could also split the baby and say if there's already an
50:22
ancillary structure and you're within that envelope maybe that doesn't have to that's what I'm saying like I think
50:28
that's a really good use case for something that could be building a whole new thing maybe that warrants yeah
50:35
review and then maybe that's where we get into some Nuance of if it's a new thing but it meets all the provisions of
50:41
the setback and the site requirements and the square footage well what do you need to go to planning board for but if
50:46
it's a new thing and there's some I don't know other criteria like the the house next door to
50:52
you is non-conforming and their side setback is only 5 yards so now you're like right next we each other maybe
50:57
that's a planning board situation yeah so the one change is is the the main structure right now we're
51:05
saying if you change the the envelope of the main structure you go to planning we
51:10
could remove that and as long as the main structure meets the setbacks it would be a permitted home uh so why not
51:18
allow that one to go through without going to planning board then when you consider the accessory buildings if
51:25
there's an existing accessory building you know and it's a 5ft setback if you
51:30
build a unit there that may interfere with that neighbor M right because it's not in the center of the lot like the
51:36
main house is so that might have criteria not absolutely yes not
51:41
absolutely no it might depend on what's around it
51:53
yeah okay that sounds good so I have I have um I think we can come back to it but I
51:59
think it sounds like maybe there's some categories that might be supportable like an exis existing accessory
52:06
structure with like minor changes to Windows and Doors right if you already have a garage that's in on the site and
52:12
it meets the setback requirements um allowing that to be converted which is building inspector approval and then
52:19
potentially main structure expansions primary structure expansions as long as you are still meeting all the setback
52:25
requirements right so technically you could be expanding that house for your own single family use um that would be
52:31
allow right the same way so now you're just expanding it but you're putting an accessory apartment in there maybe
52:37
allowing that to be permitted which is the building permit as well um and I think as we maybe start to formalize
52:44
some of the other regulations we'll see if there's other categories um that pop up but right now it sounds like if
52:50
you're doing a new well the one we haven't really talked about is like if you're doing a new accessory structure
52:55
that is detached from your primary um say it meets all the all the setback
53:00
requirements right whatever we decide those are it meets the setback requirements um does the council feel
53:06
like that's something that could also just be building inspector or do we want to keep new structures that are
53:12
detached um as something that goes site planum approval I'd like to come back to that I
53:20
I feel like maybe but need to think about it a little bit and I want to think about things not only like setback
53:27
but what about height um so there's I think there's a little bit more in that
53:32
in that use case that I think it's a maybe yep sounds good speak okay so
53:40
jumping um to the last one is hold on second Natalie just just go back to height I just I mean right now that's
53:47
that's legislated by the building code as it exists yes yeah okay and that
53:52
would apply to anything any adus Nick yeah that it's the height would apply to
54:00
those structures as well there's no separate height requirement for the Adu
54:08
okay okay so the last question is should the
54:14
city provide Financial incentives um such as fee reductions for accessory Apartments so I think that kind of um
54:22
pulls us back to Bruce's um letter where he kind of talk through some of the costs right so
54:29
application fee for the planning board or application fee for an accessory apartment
54:35
um is $750 the escrow you have to establish
54:40
is$ 3,000 so just kind of coming in out the gate if you have an application um for an accessory apartment uh
54:48
$3,750 that is for applying you also um if you're going before the planning board you do require um us engineer or
54:57
architect or someone to be doing these drawings uh for you to kind of meet the requirements um so I think Bruce did
55:04
estimate that that often costs between $5,000 and $10,000 um and all this is prior to the
55:10
actual cost of constructing these units is it oh sorry Natalie is it
55:16
possible to tie the fee reduction to the plus one program if we were to consider a fee
55:22
reduction think that's Nick no because
55:28
your I'll give that some more fault my initial reaction is no because it's really to the categories of adus and why
55:35
are you distinguishing between those that are in the plus one versus those that for some reason may not qualify for
55:41
plus one could we do it a different way by having um something that would run
55:48
concurrently with the administration of the Grant and then Sunset that's what
55:53
I'm thinking Chris yes if we tie directly somehow to our administration of it yes yeah okay I think we can get
56:00
there if you want to go there the well the yeah the reason that I'm asking that is
56:06
because part of why I think we should look at this is because of the plus one program and to let people take advantage
56:12
of that and that is income based I believe
56:18
right yes yeah 100% of Aran median income or less yeah so to me kind of
56:26
apping a reduction in fees to this income based program in my head that
56:31
makes sense but um I don't know what others think so the only thing we have control
56:39
over is the application fee and the escrow amount me regardless would they have to have a whether it's going to go
56:45
through the building department or the planning board they would still have to have uh an architect do drawings is that
56:52
correct yeah I believe um Bruce has stated that for the building permit um
56:59
uh Plans by an architector engineer are required so this is something that we saw in city of Kingston that they did
57:05
they they've had two rounds of the plus one80 program and they used some of that funding or they um pull together funding
57:13
to do um standard plans so they they hired an Architecture Firm to kind of
57:19
draft uh some model Adu plan sets that then were downloadable and could be used
57:25
so if you kind of wanted to do if you weren't trying to do a an a unique um Adu if you just wanted a standard kind
57:32
of unit you could download the plans for free and those could be your plans that you would then just have to kind of uh
57:38
site on your lot but yeah you do you are going to
57:43
require those plans to get a building permit to be to show that you're meeting building code these aren't going to be
57:50
huge the the fees that we control like the fee based on the square footage for new construction
57:56
that could be waved but that's not the principal thing here the c one of the drivers is getting the professionals to
58:03
do yeah that's uh you know signed engineered plans and we have no control over that unless unless you allow that
58:12
through I don't know do you need if I guess think of the question if you have a garage for instance and you're
58:19
converting it and you have a contractor who can do that and will say yeah this
58:25
isn't good enough shape do you need an architect if you're not changing any walls if
58:31
you're I I don't know yeah I mean I think there's a lot that architect provides in terms of you know structural
58:36
stuff um safety issues basic building codes that you know most most Builders experienced Builders will know that but
58:43
who becomes liable if it's not done exactly like that I guess the building that's the best argument yeah yeah and
58:50
certainly by requiring it to go just to the building permit stage instead of the planning board you're removing from the planning board stage that application
58:57
fee the escrow and the engineering fees for the applicant for their site plan
59:02
preparation so that's where you getting your most significant Savings in terms of the
59:08
cost and and just you know we we need to be cognizant if we wave the escrow fee
59:13
it doesn't go away we still pay the planner the city engineer and the City
59:19
attorney right only goes away if you don't require planning board approval right
59:26
so it sounds like we're doing enough work to eliminate going to planning
59:32
board in most cases and so when you do have to go it's for a reason and so I'm
59:39
I'm okay leaving the fees because we're we're basically getting rid of site plan
59:44
and therefore fees in most of the other cases okay I I think we should also look
59:50
into what Kingston did and and see if we could have some established plans maybe ask Kingston to have theirs
59:56
um it's all New York state code um so I think some people might opt to just go
1:00:03
for a off-the-shelf design um without paying any architect I'm I'm worried
1:00:08
about our capacity to do that I Kingston has a whole planning department it has
1:00:13
an in-house city engineer with multiple staff we have neither of those um we're
1:00:19
a lot smaller than Kingston in in the scope of what we do yeah but I'm just saying if say Kingston they've already
1:00:26
have these you know uh drawings made would they be willing to share
1:00:31
those those would just be in the package of Adu you know we we could share them I wouldn't want to I wouldn't want to put
1:00:38
our name behind them I don't we haven't vetted them and right and we'd have to see if we have the if Kingston has
1:00:45
rights to assign those right plans um yeah I think Nick did you send Boston to
1:00:52
us I I sent that to oh you did okay I mean this might this is really something
1:00:58
maybe Hudson River housing could work on if they're going to do this across eight municipalities yeah you know again that
1:01:05
might provide the the economy of scale to do it and I can suggest that to them
1:01:11
when we have the kickoff and and see because um I mean I think they're going
1:01:16
to struggle to get the 40 plus units that they're going to try to build
1:01:21
people aren't taking these up that quickly we've seen well well a lot of it is financially you know if they do have
1:01:29
to put a lot of money out initially some people don't even have that money to put out initially to be able to help them
1:01:37
afford their house in a little while you know it's it's a huge yeah and it's but but it's also the nature of a single
1:01:44
family home a lot of people that move to a single family home want a single family home they don't necessarily want
1:01:50
to share it with somebody who's going to be sharing a wall or a driveway or a yard but if financially they were
1:01:57
strapped that they feel they they need to do something they just can't afford
1:02:02
to do this yeah I mean that's why we're doing it so the people that don't have that
1:02:10
concern I can talk to Hudson River housing because that that would be
1:02:15
something that I think they would want to do for all of their municipalities sense maybe the count
1:02:22
they can get the county to help with it because they definitely have more expertise don't have much in house to
1:02:27
work with on this yeah no I understand that I like the scale of that idea I
1:02:32
think that the uncertainty the confusion is preventing the uptake of the program so if there was something where there was a limited number of even modular
1:02:39
designs that could reduce the decision making hurdles that was vetted so I think that's something we should look
1:02:44
into not supporting necessarily but doing what we can to encourage another
1:02:54
entity that's all all really helpful feedback so I think we have some good Direction with these so we can come back
1:03:01
with um I think some diagrams to help visualize um the setback requirements
1:03:08
and things like that and I think we can come up with a draft language for the other sections that we had more Resolute
1:03:13
uh kind of discussions about so um appreciate you guys' time and walking through this and we'll come back to you
1:03:19
with some uh draft legislation to consider and I'll reach out to the Department of planning and development
1:03:26
and see if this is something they might be willing to take on as part of their housing affordability what a I mean
1:03:33
again like Boston is is a big city and that has a lot of resources Duchess is a
1:03:38
probably smaller in population by by some but they have might have the resources to do it that's great
1:03:49
thanks thank you so next one is also a zoning issue
1:04:00
we um and uh which is on East Main so there is an issue that was brought to
1:04:07
our attention and um is it uh Natalie or Nick you want to talk through this one
1:04:12
or not which one of you does believe Natalie is because it's more of the Planning and Zoning aspect but you do
1:04:17
have in your agenda packet the building inspectors of Bruce's Memo from February 5th as well as his um zoning diagram
1:04:25
zoning chart that goes through an area where he suggest it would be appropriate
1:04:31
for the council to consider and again this is the first step no decisions have been made we haven't drafted a local law
1:04:37
it's just here for the initial discussion and this would be the first step is for the council to consider if
1:04:42
it wishes to consider resoning along the East Main Street Parcels as indicated in
1:04:48
U Bruce's memorandum and he really had noticed there a change in the use where it might be more appropriate for some of
1:04:55
these properties to be relocated into the CMS
1:05:03
Zone and so Bruce is attached the map and the um zoning use charge for those two districts for the council to
1:05:10
consider whether this is something you wish to advance for the preparation of a local law at which would be referred to
1:05:16
the county and city planning boards and a public caring scheduled to receive public
1:05:21
input would be zoning particular properties is is there a background on
1:05:28
why this is coming up um this came up because of one East Main Street track's
1:05:34
coffee house um wasn't in compliance with the current zoning um and I'm I
1:05:41
don't know all the details on it but that's that was the Genesis of oh really so the someone else is buying it and I
1:05:49
it was and and correct me if I'm wrong Nick it was um let Li and it's really
1:05:59
for it limited whether you could have seating in a coffee house for some
1:06:04
reason interesting me out here yeah so I think the coffee grinding Was An Li use
1:06:10
Light Industry right but you limited how many seats you could have in there for a
1:06:16
coffee house so like in thinking about particularly that one property I don't
1:06:21
know if this logic would extend behind it because you already have some push back back from Hudson Valley Brewery cuz
1:06:27
they really are Li but along the future rail trail it might be worth considering
1:06:34
additional uses in that property yeah I guess I would I that's interesting that
1:06:40
there a current issue and you kind of Wonder like how they how they ended up as a business if
1:06:46
they weren't a permitted use um I think they kept it below a certain number of seats but like it came out recently
1:06:54
because they're doing renovations they're selling okay yeah I mean understanding
1:07:02
some of the concerns around like the light industrial aspects of s East Main
1:07:09
I feel like maybe it's not worth opening that up at this point um but doing it
1:07:14
for one East M I'm curious as to why both were were
1:07:20
considered excuse me S I assume it I I app I had the same
1:07:26
question Amber and I assume one of the reasons that whole block came up is also because the parking lot is apparently
1:07:32
also nonconforming for Li um and so if we wanted to consider updates to that
1:07:38
parking lot and future uses of it for other parking needs that that is also Limited in its current zoning is my
1:07:45
understanding if I'm reading the table correctly well it's a governmental youth which is permitted in any District so
1:07:52
that's not it's not a private parking lot you need to move back from your mic again sorry it's a governmental use
1:07:59
which is permitted so it's it's not a private parking lot stay right there so
1:08:04
if we were to build a governmental parking structure there that would be okay correct okay
1:08:13
great so this is interesting so let me ask the question the LI use that is in
1:08:19
that which is the brewery is that permitted under in CMS
1:08:25
permitted both places The Brew is permitted Brew uh bar Brew Pub micro
1:08:31
Brewery micro Distillery are permitted in both CMS and Li okay so that would
1:08:36
say um the brewery on that site wouldn't shouldn't have a problem going one way
1:08:42
or the other it's be a matter of communication is that right they may be concerned if it's considered
1:08:48
manufacturing use like I I guess it does cuz they're they might whole they may
1:08:55
not even apply to they may not be a maybe that's what you're getting at as a it may not be a micro Brewer standed
1:09:02
beyond that yeah and might yeah you could limit it to one East Main I mean that was you're trying to fix something
1:09:08
bigger than was the problem yeah yeah well so one option is to
1:09:15
allow um such uses in the CMS another option would be to you know leave the
1:09:21
brewery in Li move the one East Main Building into
1:09:26
CMS um Nick Natalie is there an option where we could say properties you know
1:09:32
budding the creek had the option of CMS or Li zoning are we allowed to do something like
1:09:37
that so I've seen in some zoning codes right where you do allow different regulations to apply
1:09:45
within if you're within X number of feet of a particular zoning District or defining feature not best practices
1:09:53
because it can be confusing yeah I it's kind of generally referred to is it's a little bit of a a floating
1:09:59
District right where it gets it gets pulled down upon request uh by the property
1:10:06
owners and this also had to do with the multifam housing I guess that they're Limited in the LI to artists live work
1:10:15
and that's that's kind of like yeah I'm an artist I'm living there and
1:10:20
working yeah top doll I don't know and that's supposed to be in as well isn't
1:10:26
that yeah so that was I'm now remembering like that's not inspected it's not just artists so you're really
1:10:33
out of conformance on one East M that was the only problem we weren't trying to do I think he included seven East
1:10:40
Main and Church Hill parking lot because they were also Ali but the the issue was the one be okay oh sorry Pam go ahead I
1:10:48
was just it does makees sense like when you look at the map and you're like oh yeah just change it all and I could
1:10:54
understand it where they talking of the future of rail trail I think some of it might just be communication and just
1:11:03
confirming the uses where I think it might not be even an issue to go to CMS
1:11:09
if it turns out that the current uses there on all those properties are allowed in the CMS Zone
1:11:19
yeah and I was just going to say I mean I feel like if the the challenge that we're trying to address is at one East
1:11:24
Main like let's just take care of one East Main and then like not worry about the especially because I'm I'm thinking
1:11:30
that one East Main must have some urgency behind it because of the sale and so I would say like okay let's
1:11:38
figure that out and just leave seven East Main out of it for now if we do need to address it when the rail trail
1:11:44
comes around like totally agree we have to make sure that um you know the The
1:11:49
Distillery Brewery distinction still works for the use that's there um but it
1:11:55
just feels like we're making this bigger than it has to be I mean but it looked like it made sense to yeah yeah seemed
1:12:02
like an easy face and and we didn't want to get in the business of trying to figure out who's an artist and yes
1:12:08
working and living in this I mean there's nothing counterproductive or counter to the original intent in
1:12:14
reversing that artists live workspace that we we'd be doing I mean is it those those are condos at this point I mean
1:12:21
you how how do you regulate that it's so basically the out of the bar
1:12:27
somebody made a mistake some years ago the out the bar sounds like it and there's no way there's nothing we can do
1:12:33
in terms of a requirement that would affect the affordability of any of those spaces at this point in time I I
1:12:40
wouldn't deem that many of them are affordable at this time in terms of
1:12:46
communication as as this advances do we reach out do we send something to the uh
1:12:52
tenants all the tenants and the owners of those units about resoning changes well they'd get a
1:12:59
notice right yeah I think they get a notice be a public
1:13:05
hearing Nick would the impacted owners in the one East Main get a notice the
1:13:12
owners would but the tenants would not we the notice goes to the the owners of a property's on record with the City
1:13:17
Assessor and then there's of course public notice on the city's website but if they're condos they'd get
1:13:24
the notice CU they're own those list correct correct got it and even the the
1:13:31
the commercial units are condo ised oh okay so I I I'm with Amber in
1:13:39
that look there's a quick fix let's do that but I just want to put on the table
1:13:44
that there is a a medium-term issue that we should address which is that our
1:13:50
zones assumed our old city where you know oh the creek that's industrial um
1:13:57
Main Street no it doesn't it doesn't get anywhere near the creek because there's a train tracks there and nobody has you
1:14:03
know Main Street style buildings on the other side of the tracks that's all gone and which is wonderful right because
1:14:10
because we're breaking that barrier of the tracks um i' just like us to be looking at our uses by districts and I
1:14:17
think the medium-term issue is we may consolidate our districts and simplify our uses into broader categories right
1:14:25
so we don't have to worry about is it a what kind of Distillery is it is it this kind is it this size it's just like
1:14:32
anything that's a brewery or a bar or a Distillery is okay right and if it's on
1:14:37
Main Street they have to be willing to pay top dollar for it which will probably limit the size of it um but
1:14:43
anyway that I think is for another day right curious about the parking lot though you said it's a government use
1:14:49
it's currently it's a municipal lot yeah the the the one to the Sou yeah on
1:14:56
Churchill so between Churchill and um Hudson Valley Brewery is one of our
1:15:01
public Lots so it's a city-owned municipal lot and no change needs to happen to allow it to continue we're
1:15:08
good correct because in your table of uses a governmental facility is permitted as a permitted use in all
1:15:13
districts if if you wanted to redevelop that which was a proposal some years ago under John Clark then you might want to
1:15:21
look at your zoning I I don't see any plans in the next 5 years to do that
1:15:27
honestly right remember we have on our long-term to-do list the potential building on top of parking lots this
1:15:33
wouldn't be our first choice but that's yeah that's not my first choice either
1:15:38
okay so is the next step that someone should propose what's the quick fix or
1:15:44
do we already know what that is Nick can draft it up if you just want to move move move the zoning you're changing the
1:15:49
Zone okay the zoning just for one East Main right yeah right joining prop is
1:15:55
CMS so we would just be extending the CMS to the one East Main Street property
1:16:01
okay that works yep everybody good yes okay two down uh oh loap we have length
1:16:09
of Service Awards this is for our volunteer firefighters Chris yeah so we do this every year
1:16:16
where you certify the hours and the credits that volunteers have received for for people tuning in losap is length
1:16:24
of service award program it was an incentive for volunteer firefighters so that for each year you earned you got a
1:16:32
contribution towards the defined benefit plan when you turn 55 um so for our program you earn $20 a
1:16:41
month for life after age 55 for each year that you record up to 20 years um
1:16:47
as as you know from talking to the fire chief we're down to just a handful of active volunteers so there really was
1:16:54
only a few people that earned any credits this year but nonetheless we have to certify that um you really have
1:17:01
only three members at this point that earned points and um you have to have 50
1:17:07
points to earn a year um I just want to let you know we we are still spending
1:17:12
money on this because we have 53 people on the system already um so we do spend
1:17:19
we allocated $57,000 in the budget this year just so you have an idea you know
1:17:24
we're we're going to carry those costs probably for you know another several decades and and again we don't have a
1:17:31
lot of new volunteers coming on because of the training requirements and and the
1:17:37
time constraints so this is just to certify
1:17:43
this um we've done this every year and then um so it looks like your list is saying
1:17:51
there are five that have maxed out that are still active and three that have not
1:17:58
maxed out and are getting credits and then and then the rest of the list is all getting payouts
1:18:06
today because I don't think that's totally accurate but you're close okay
1:18:11
yeah in the ballpark remove the numbers some some of them who have maxed
1:18:17
out are not active still oh okay yes they but they've maxed out
1:18:26
okay so got it yeah I don't know the difference between entitled invested so
1:18:31
I do entitled means that you've earned your credit and you're over
1:18:37
55 um vested means you've earned the credit to be eligible but you haven't hit
1:18:45
age okay thank you yes so and we have a you know we have a
1:18:51
portfolio of Investments that are managed for this to pay it it's kind of like a a mini um
1:18:57
retirement system from New York State and it it's very modest the most they get a year is
1:19:04
$4,800 um so if we do Recruit new volunteers which we hope to get some
1:19:09
good ones um they would also be in the program if they make a certain number of calls each
1:19:18
year all right everybody good mhm all right um so the next one is the
1:19:25
appointment of Brian Murphy to building inspector um that's the guy who's sitting over there Chris is going to
1:19:31
introduce him and uh he's been listening to us talk about zoning so it's probably good well I'm delighted to have Brian uh
1:19:38
Murphy here with us tonight I just wanted to give a little background for those tuning in um this position is
1:19:45
building inspector 2 um the council had asked why it's not building inspector
1:19:50
one that really is a classification based on your population so if you have over 10,000 residents you're building
1:19:57
inspector too and then civil service has a title both for one for towns and one
1:20:03
for City so this is for the city um our building department currently is five
1:20:08
people it's a building in building inspector 2 two Deputy building inspectors and two support staff which
1:20:16
are classified as Municipal secretaries um the position that we're hiring for
1:20:21
came about because Bruce flower um who came to work for us in September 2022
1:20:28
went in early February to work for the town of pipy we pulled the list from Civil Service which is a certification
1:20:35
of eligibles it's the people that took the test specifically for this position
1:20:40
um we ended up interviewing the two highest scoring people one of which was
1:20:46
Brian and um we've we've um did a subsequent interview with Brian which
1:20:51
also included having our current Deputy building inspectors take him around town
1:20:57
show him the development talk to him about what he had done they were very comfortable with that um so Bruce Sarah
1:21:03
and I all interviewed him the mayor came in briefly for part of the interview um and we have um we we would like to offer
1:21:11
him the job and bring to you um his appointment um he's he's going to talk
1:21:17
about his background a little bit and then we also have scheduled an executive session so we can have a little bit more
1:21:23
candid conversation which we do for building uh which we do for department heads um so again we
1:21:30
didn't want to have necessarily the um the hiring interview in public but at
1:21:35
least we wanted to introduce um Brian and and let him talk a little bit about
1:21:40
his background and and what he's he's bringing to the city of Beacon so with that i' I'd introduce Brian and welcome
1:21:47
to um the city of Beacon and
1:21:55

1:22:16
consideration of joining the department and to begin contributing to the team um a little bit about my experience
1:22:25
uh my experience I uh was a small business owner I had owned a construction company previously um prior
1:22:33
to that I had sat on the uh villager wer fall zoning board uh for 3
1:22:39
years uh prior to or I sat on the Zoning Board of the
1:22:45
village of offers Falls um I've been the building inspector for the zoning of w or for the building of I've been the
1:22:53
building inspector for the village of wers falls for the last 13 years
1:23:00
um sorry about that and that I've been the building
1:23:07
insor the work includes working very closely with the planning boards and the zoning boards um as the building
1:23:14
inspector of the village I'm also the manager of the department and I have extensive uh
1:23:21
technical skills in municity 5 which the city Beacon currently uses for their building uh permits and also laser laser
1:23:30
Fe cloud is the records retention for the village of w and the City of Beacon
1:23:36
also uses it um much to the to the responsibilities outlined in the city of
1:23:42
Beacon building inspector position my present job includes supervising and
1:23:48
participation in the inspections of construction and repair of buildings and structures including Plumbing
1:23:54
installations the enforcement of the provisions of the uniform fire prevention code of New York State uh all
1:24:02
zoning and plumbing ordinances and the multiple residence law um additionally I'm also responsible
1:24:11
responsible for reviewing and approving or disapproving all building permit plans and specifications submitted with
1:24:18
applications for local building and plumbing permits as the zoning administrator for
1:24:23

1:25:17
consideration for either remodel construction or just management um along along along with
1:25:25

that's okay thank you yeah so did what um did did we want
1:25:45
to move into executive session or was there anything else that what we would
1:25:50
propose to do was to you know introduce Brian in public that we could vote next week and then we um if if you want to
1:25:57
move to Executive session then we can have kind of a more candid conversation we we do try to avoid having you know
1:26:05
like HR conversations public um and um
1:26:10
okay Nick did you have anything I thank you Chris I was just going to repeat what you said and also with respect to
1:26:17
this position concerning it's about interpretations determinations and enforcement it's best held in executive
1:26:22
session okay all right is uh are people interested in that I mean I interviewed
1:26:29
the person so I'm good so it's up to you all I mean I I generally don't really
1:26:36
think I have any specific questions but we we put it on there just in case happy
1:26:43
if if if others do I'll try to deal with my my wounded Pride if you don't do an
1:26:49
executive session I think I could get over it though the only question and I
1:26:54
don't believe it's going to um be an HR uh question but um you on your resume
1:27:01
you talked about digital archiving of Building Department Records yes and I understand that we have we've recently
1:27:06
purchased a scanner of some sort we didn't purchase it yet and he had a better idea oh they they actually rented
1:27:14
one there which makes a lot of sense cuz sorry I so we we uh like the city be we
1:27:22
had many blueprints from long ago and many original copies of people's files
1:27:28
so we were able to find a company called Hartford Hartford out of Long Island that you're were able to rent large
1:27:36
large formatted scanners um and at that time it was $485
1:27:41
a month we didn't want to purchase it because eventually we were going to run
1:27:46
out of its use since we now require everything to be electronic so that was
1:27:52
the reasoning behind the rent on there was a a great company that we found came with the
1:27:58
software no that's great when Brian raised that we're like aha we don't have to buy a $6,000 piece of equipment and
1:28:05
store it for the rest of time that we probably only need to use for uh you
1:28:11
know not for ever and ever yeah what a good idea software they
1:28:17
came believe we had it for like 8 months and they came in like four months and
1:28:23
cleaned it and everything for part part of their maintenance agreement with us the software was quite easy um CU it is
1:28:30
a large machine in smaller offices they they Le the one the the village had rented it's large it took up quite a bit
1:28:37
of room but we just knew it was there temporarily so it worked out really well for us well that's great I'm glad you're
1:28:43
familiar with this process and recognize the importance of it as well so that's great then then the rest of the archive
1:28:49
and we had many filing cabinets of what I would know as original files to property mhm and slowly we would just
1:28:55
start scanning one or two of them in or if you were in that file for a reason we would pull it and make it a point to Now
1:29:03
scan it into our server and Laser Fe Cloud which was our records retention
1:29:09
you know so work it's been working out we're not done right um but it's working out very well we're getting a lot uh
1:29:16
digitalized terrific and then now we also require all submitt we try at least
1:29:22
all submitt to be electronically submitted we're doing that now ex
1:29:28
there's one page you have to have signed and um the rest is all
1:29:33
digital yes that's us also you know you do have to sign the permit application
1:29:38
for some you know it's hard to either do it through Adobe or digitally sign it so we do get um some papers that are we do
1:29:47
get some hard copies also then we just scan okay I did notice you were a fellow
1:29:54
Spartan so yes I am I was a little before you yes you also yes
1:30:00
okay I don't want to blor the discussions but maybe I don't know if it's an HR question but I am curious about Advanced building techniques I
1:30:06
know we have an advanced energy code that we adopted here in the city you know I'm just was just part of the discussions in the interview that's it
1:30:14
wasn't so you want to address that um being the the stretch code you're referring to yep you know familiar are
1:30:20
with the stretch code it's you know it's it's there's a you you know very well that the code is anever evolving process
1:30:26
so curious absolutely I do yeah so I'm curious about your experience like with the with the The Cutting Edge of the
1:30:32
building code more generally across all the CH the nine chapters in particular the energy code but you know fostering
1:30:38
kind of a broader education for what we could ask for here in Beacon amongst other inspectors so I'm curious about
1:30:44
your that experience you know I I'm pretty well versed on the energy
1:30:50
code um the village of Whoppers has not adopted this stretch code so I have not
1:30:56
worked with it that much but I have quite a bit of training in the energy
1:31:02
code itself and our guys told them about our electrification law that we you know all
1:31:09
new development has to be electric except for a few exemptions and Beacon
1:31:14
was considering the zero energy code as well too at one point in time I'm not sure where that stands in the process
1:31:20
but it is a forward leaning City so I just want to G comfort with that and thank you I was
1:31:27
aware of that so I started looking in nerta that there are many uh stretch
1:31:32
code you know uh webinars and things like that that you can go go back to and
1:31:37
watch and even going forwards um getting to all the training and that's absolutely what I would
1:31:45
do you know yeah because there aren't too many co uh municipalities that I know of that have adopted the stretch
1:31:51
around here the town of wengers had right which is where Bruce came from I'm I'm sorry Leah
1:31:58
didn't hear you yeah I don't think town of wengers town of pipsy sorry where
1:32:03
Bruce came from had adopted stretch coat either I think we were one of the few I think you are one of the few that have
1:32:09
adopted huh yeah well and of course when we adopted it our building inspector at the time had to learn it as well so it's
1:32:14
certainly not you know certainly not impossible yeah no it's not I mean you know it's above and beyond the regular
1:32:22
energy code but you know there there's quite a bit of training out there that that's available you know and I'm
1:32:27
certainly willing to to do it you know I mean we're required to keep certain amount of training every year anyway and
1:32:34
you're you're an important resource for the builders that might be complying with it too so that's a really important aspect of the job particularly around
1:32:40
this I'm I'm nerding out but I help develop the energy stretch code excellent no I certainly be
1:32:48
interested you know like I said uh started looking at it up once I realized
1:32:53
said you guys were were stretch code um started doing a little bit of research like I said nier of has a lot of uh
1:33:01
looks to be great classes you know recorded webinars and everything along those lines out there yeah so you're
1:33:08
discovering in our conversation this evening we have energy code Geeks and we have zoning Geeks and it's an
1:33:14
interesting Council because of it right that's great it's actually council is what it is and that's that's an
1:33:20
excellent thing yeah I I actually think it means that we're going to be very support of yeah that sound like a wealth
1:33:26
of information that hopefully you know I could tap into if need be of course
1:33:32
excellent and mayor if I could just highlight and thank um Corey worthman for filling in his acting building
1:33:38
direct building inspector he's been doing a fantastic job Corey was not on the list of eligibles he didn't take the
1:33:45
test because he didn't know Bruce was leaving um but I think he's happy with our choice as was the other Deputy
1:33:52
building inspector um and U if you're ready we would love to bring him to Council next week and um
1:34:00
so that he can give his notice to the Village of wers yeah I'm happy to move forward yeah
1:34:07
and I'll also note his his um references were absolutely glowing wonderful so I
1:34:13
would have said that in um executive session but let's say it out loud now
1:34:18
