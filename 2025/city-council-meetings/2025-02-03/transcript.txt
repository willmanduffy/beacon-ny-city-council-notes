0:34
justice for all thank you all all
0:41
right so um U as I understand it there's an accident on the bridge westbound
0:47
which has caused all the traffic to back up in Beacon among other places um but
0:52
somehow you all got here so uh in terms of roll call I See Molly Jeff Amber Le
0:58
here Paloma George uh Pam I believe you're online
1:04
yes I'm online okay that's full role and then I see the city administrator here and I think the City attorney is online
1:11
good evening mayor and council members thank you okay so let's do
1:19
public comments first um is there a hearing tonight there are a couple of
1:24
hearings tonight so two of them concern property tax exemptions for senior
1:29
citizens and disable persons with limited income and then there's also a public hearing
1:34
on a community block development Grant if you'd like to speak on those please hold your remarks the first opportunity
1:41
for public comments is General commentary so other than those topics you can talk on anything you like uh and
1:48
I'll start with Teresa
1:57
craft good evening I'd like to request that you bring back the detailed minutes following the
2:03
minutes online is fruitless there is no paper trail and watching videos to find information is next to
2:11
Impossible we have done the city a great disservice by allowing cookie cutter building design to erode our historic
2:17
landscape our Landmark preservation oversight barely exists we are allowing
2:22
Builders to strip away any detail from today's construction what's described on a real estate listing as a restoration
2:29
is a rehab these buildings are being replaced by plain boxes all looking the same they represent the aesthetic values
2:36
of their rep respective errors the old houses exemplifies how a modest vacular
2:43
Cottage can enhance any streetscape through its pleasing mass and well-considered
2:48
proportions in contrast these feeble Replacements reflect our current de
2:53
humanizing age we have lost even the modest ornamentation found on the original there are no column bases or
3:01
capitals on the stunted crude supports of a porch no interplay of light on the traditional lattice underneath and no
3:08
Shadow lines on the molding list cornices which appears as unresolved as
3:13
a child's drawing The Big Box generic front doors and budget Windows stare
3:18
blankly at our community emphasizing the cold lifeless proportions of the entire
3:24
structure how is it that a farmhouse once considered rustic by fashionable Victorian City dwell ERS who came up
3:31
here can be so much more sophisticated than a 21st century building designed by an architectural firm the answer is
3:38
simple 19th century Carpenter Builders utiliz pattern books created by architects who had mastered their craft
3:45
through traditional methods including proper drafting skills and careful measurements of existing buildings in
3:51
contrast today's postmodernist Architects often lack these fundamental drafting skills and get them produced by
3:59
AI or in China and some have not even measured a historic structure and some
4:04
have gotten lost along the way buildings cannot lie today's practitioners may get
4:10
away with these poor designs as long as residents of Beacon do not protect their Irreplaceable past and fail to demand
4:17
better for their Collective future last week I overheard somebody who's been in Beacon for a dozen years telling people
4:24
in the room that the middle of Main Street used to have tall buildings too but they tore those down and put up
4:30
lower buildings modern buildings and said they thought it was okay because people are coming and putting up taller
4:36
buildings again that's all the more reasons that we need to have a beacon Museum in the center of Main Street at
4:42
The Old Firehouse I do not want to see it become Monopoly Ville and you know
4:47
those two names that I'm putting together we might as well just change the name of Beacon today watching this
4:53
Council table we can see it's an election year I'd advise the residents to keep their ears to the ground and get
4:59
involved thank you thank you uh Johanna
5:11
funnel okay can you hear me yeah y okay I'm reading this because I went be able to get it all then if I don't um I've
5:19
spoken here before on the need for bike Lanes on 52 and I'm here to do so once again but before I get into that I want
5:25
to clarify why I'm continuing to speak up on this issue it is not solely because I'm current cyclist that uses 52
5:32
I am not simply asking for accommodations for myself and others like me I am speaking at Council because
5:37
I believe that the city of Beacon can and should be thinking much more seriously about developing an active
5:43
Transportation Network that is to say encouraging more people to make more daily Journeys by bike or foot we could
5:50
be doing so much more to encourage cycling with M beon There Is Us data to support the fact that the majority of a
5:56
given population is open to cycling for transportation but you first have to make people feel comfortable and less
6:01
stressed about doing so particularly by developing more bike infrastructure and so why should we care
6:07
about getting more people on bikes there are many reasons but in particular I want to point out that Beacon
6:13
continually faces difficult issues around development congestion and parking and I know the council has
6:18
recently made some decisions around reducing parking minimums but unless we think more seriously about actively
6:23
managing transport demand rather than simply manipulating parking Supply we
6:29
won't have solved done long term so I believe that the promotion of biking is an essential strategic tool within City
6:36
Planning thinking about walkability is great but in my opinion it's not entirely sufficient to create meaningful
6:42
change in the reduction of personal vehicle miles so let's take 52 for many residents and I'm thinking particularly
6:49
of WS two and four here getting to businesses along 52 such as the red pepper Diner industrial Arts Mountain
6:54
View dentists are all between 2 and 2.5 mil away from home that's just a little
7:00
too far for a lot of people to consider walking so I doubt we'll see much volume switch from Cars to foot Journeys no
7:06
matter how extensive the sidewalk we buil on the other hand bikes are perfect for that distance you can get to those
7:12
businesses in around 15 minutes so bike Lanes on 52 simply means simply seems like a no-brainer to
7:18
me I know that some of you will say the rail trail back to me but as I and other
7:23
people have said before this cannot fully be the answer although the rail trail will undoubtedly be used by some
7:29
people for some Transportation Journeys it does not fully meet the demand for a robust active Transportation Network
7:36
I'll end on a personal ple even though I said this wasn't personal please don't put on street parking on 52 this won't
7:43
be a status quo outcome for current cyclist it makes things exponentially worse because you will be removing the
7:49
shoulder that's currently there so you're forcing cyclist to choose either being DED by careless stationary drivers
7:56
or being rear endered by being pushed when we're pushed out into the lane by truck TR and cars you will be running us
8:02
off the lane running us off the road whether literally or metaphorically at this point Who's to tell thank you thank
8:09
you very much Meg Lazarus think she stuck in track okay
8:17
she sent me her notes and I will read those that she drafted earlier I you see mag lazaros raised her
8:24
hand online oh is she there good okay so we'll take that when the um
8:31
we go to online and we'll just pass on this right now but we'll get back to her in just a minute okay so Christine
8:46
Wang um good evening Mr mayor council city council I'm reading for Sergey crov
8:51
War I who couldn't be here you have heard me talking about Fishkill Avenue as cyclist today I want
8:58
to give you my my perspective as a driver almost every morning I drop my daughter off at the middle school then
9:04
go left on Fishkill Avenue to drive to one nature Nursery just outside City Limits exactly the stretch we have been
9:11
debating about every morning in any weather I encounter at least one but usually more cyclists going towards the
9:17
city pretty clear they don't do it for fun but because a bicycle is the only
9:24
means for them to go to work some of them would cycle in the direction of the traffic some against weaving in and out
9:31
of the shoulders avoiding potholes cars parked at length and random garbage on
9:38
quite a few occasions I came very close to colliding with the cyclist either because of their unpredicted Maneuvers
9:44
low visibility in the fog or rain serving to avoid an incoming vehicle
9:50
Crossing into my lane only to discover a cyclist on my right in dark clothes and
9:55
no lights of course I'm not here to speak to seek your sympathy or complain about
10:01
the cyclists I'm here to make a point about how the lack of safe bike infrastruct infrastructure affects not
10:08
only the cyclists but the drivers as well these cyclists are on the road today tomorrow and every day from now
10:16
till potentially distant future when the rail trail is built personally I'm very
10:21
excited for the rail trail but it is not a Panacea and it doesn't address the
10:27
issues we're facing now is issues we can address with dedicated and protected bike Lan bike Lanes on Fishkill
10:34
Avenue also on street parking on fishco Avenue brought up at the last city council Workshop while I'm receptive to
10:42
the argument that narrowing traffic Lanes reduces speed indeed it does eliminating elimination of the shoulders
10:50
will make cycling drastically more dangerous as it will push cyclists to directly compete with a road space with
10:56
drivers I have been assaulted by drivers while cycling on our main street they drove a
11:03
foot behind my rear rear wheel with their hand on the horn and yelling obscenities at me and mind you I'm
11:11
fairly strong and fast cyclist imagine the road rage is a if a young family
11:17
older folks people with injuries try to cycle in a traffic lane on Fishkill Avenue during rush
11:23
hours another major issue with adding parking alone fish go Avenue cyclists
11:28
getting door 15 seconds when a drivers or passengers open the door without checking if there is anyone behind them
11:36
I got door twice including by NYPD trust me not fun I want to ask the council to
11:43
WAN carefully the effects of your decisions Upon A various group of the residents and visitors to our
11:49
city thank you
11:54
uh Thomas Wright
12:02
good evening Thomas right 24 Grove Street uh Beacon bcle
12:08
Coalition please follow the Fishkill Avenue Concepts committee's recommendation to prohibit
12:13
drive-throughs in the Fishkill Avenue Corridor that was presented to the council in the January 27th Workshop
12:20
also please review the memo from the conservation advisory committee and it's rationale for recommending the
12:25
prohibition of drive-thru that was sent to the council please also remember the climate Act of
12:31
New York state and its recommendations for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by incorporating non vehicular Mobility
12:39
into planning and as you're thinking about the very real and negative safety
12:44
and climate impacts of drive-throughs please also consider bike Lanes on
12:49
Fishkill Avenue we have seen in the engineering drawings prepared for the reworking of Fishkill Avenue Corridor
12:55
that there is ample room in the right of way for buffered by bike Lanes we urge the city of Beacon to use the space to
13:02
incorporate buffered bike Lanes into the roadway work there has been some discussion about offering on street
13:09
parking along this part of Fishkill Avenue on street parking should absolutely be rejected in the Fishkill
13:15
Avenue Zone as it would make already dangerous biking conditions far worse and in fact untenable by removing the
13:23
shoulder instead of setting aside space for cars to make it easier to drive instead of walk or or bike Reserve this
13:30
space instead for buffered bike Lanes with buffered bike Lanes in the Fishkill
13:36
Avenue Zone we achieve improved safety reduced Reliance on cars and reduced
13:41
pollution that comes from people choosing biking overdriving we achieve improved quality of life if you only
13:49
remember one thing about these comments it is this plan for people not for cars
13:55
thank you thank you uh ion
14:06
carther good evening I don't have prepared remarks I just wanted to share
14:12
an anecdote that surprises me every time it happens which is that I'll be walking down the street and run into somebody
14:18
that I know somebody that I know doesn't particularly follow city council goings on very closely and I'm stunned at how
14:27
often they say we we're so glad that we have a bike Coalition and that you guys are raising Transportation issues at
14:34
city council because we've wanted to see changes for a long time so I just wanted
14:39
to pass that on that we come and we share our knowledge of biking and our
14:45
experiences because we know we have broad public support thank you thank you
14:52
uh Andrea mullet hello hello thank you uh I'm a
15:00
resident of Beacon and I'm here at uh city council meeting for the very first time to uh speak and support of
15:07
something that my family and I care a lot about which is protected bike Lanes along uh Fishkill Avenue my family and I
15:15
uh live within 5 minutes of the 52 quor and since arriving here we have so
15:20
enjoyed biking to places like Ron and Memorial Park and tracks and Roma pizza
15:28
and the yard all places that uh it would not have been so easy to walk to and now
15:34
that our son is uh a student at Beacon high school he bikes to school and
15:40
around town every day and uh frankly my husband and I worry about him a lot we
15:46
just uh we just very much want him to be safe on his bike and we want the same
15:51
for all of his friends and all of our cycling neighbors um and so I believe
15:58
that protected by bik lanes and uh no uh on street parking alongside uh Fishkill
16:05
are uh vital to this and uh furthermore I believe that there are few better ways
16:12
to uh make Fishkill Avenue a thriving commercial Corridor than to allow uh
16:19
cyclists and uh families and people without cars to be able to do errands
16:28
and bike and enjoy that carer uh without uh feeling in threat of their lives
16:34
thank you all so much thank you uh Michael
16:47
Patrick I don't have any prepared notes I just wanted to bring attention to people living with disabilities and
16:53
limited income and also try to Lobby a little bit for more affordable hous in in
17:00
Duchess County that's all thank you thank you very much uh Rachel
17:12
smucker hello uh I'm a beacon resident and homeowner I am also here in support
17:19
of the bike Lanes on Route 52 um I know this has been discussed as part of the fish go Concepts committee's
17:25
work um I am personally invested in this because I do not have a car I walk bike
17:32
ebike and take the bus everywhere I can um having bike Lanes on Route 52 would
17:37
make a huge difference in my life personally thank you thank you very much
17:43
uh same address Don hard to see what your last name is but let us
17:52
know uh my name is Don manello I'm also a beacon resident and I'm speaking in support of bike lane on 52 and bike
18:00
Lanes in general um we do not have a car we are a carless household the amount
18:06
that we would spend on a car is roughly the amount we pay in property taxes uh which is to me which is to say that if
18:13
we had a car we wouldn't be able to live in Beacon so the option is we could either get a car and send that, a month
18:20
to Detroit and overseas and to Hartford for insurance and maybe a little bit
18:26
goes to a mechanic locally or we could send it here lights look great um so I'm
18:32
I want to um speak highly in support of more extensive biking infrastructure
18:38
Less Car Reliance giving people options and that's it thank you thank you very
18:43
much um anyone else in the public audience the physical public want to make a comment other than the public
18:52
hearings sure coming up tell us who you are where you
18:57
live hello uh uh Joe O Brien Applegate uh live in Ward 4 and uh I'd also like to uh speak to
19:06
the Council on the importance of uh I guess bike Lanes on Route 52 and more comprehensive uh Transit planning in
19:13
general uh you know I live in Beacon largely because it's a city where I can
19:20
get to most all of my needs through walking or biking um you know expanding
19:27
that to the Route 50 2 Corridor uh especially if there are projected to be
19:32
a large number of residents that are going to be moving in at one end of the corridor along it uh you know I think we
19:40
should start planning for that now and we should also uh keep in mind the
19:45
city's uh you leadership and commitment to
19:51
uh uh you know uh the climate and to equity in uh you providing alternative
19:57
modes of transportation to our residents um potential of replacing the
20:03
shoulder on Route 52 with side parking would make that stretch of road even more dangerous for cyclists than it
20:08
already is and uh yeah would exacerbate the already car
20:15
Centric planning in the city so uh thank you for your time thank you very
20:20
much okay uh no one else in the physical public all right so now let's go online
20:27
for uh comments Ben if you're on zoom and you'd like to make a public comment this evening
20:33
please use the raised hand option at the bottom of your screen if you're joining by phone you can press star9 lastly if
20:40
you're joining us on YouTube you will actually need to join us on Zoom instead you can do so by visiting Deacon n.gov
20:46
and finding the link on our community calendar mayor right now we have three an raised first of which is Meg lazaros
20:54
Meg you a permission to speak whenever you're ready thank you hi there
20:59
uh I'm NE Lazarus W one resident and member of Beacon climate Action Now Beacon Bicycle Coalition I'm speaking to
21:06
advocate for bike master plan for the city of Beacon and to urge that bike infrastructure be prioritized as
21:11
Planning and Development move forward on tral Avenue um as I've become more involved
21:17
in the bike Coalition I've tried to understand how we've reached this point where building bike infrastructure feels
21:23
like a radical idea the benefits of bikable and loable cities are really well documented from positive
21:29
environmental impacts to Stronger Community connections reduced crime uh
21:34
greater Independence for children and young adults increased home value like the list goes on and on but despite
21:40
these advantages people Centric cities are disappearing Across America and we've sadly normalized car dependency um
21:48
and we don't really give much thought to Alternatives and of being a car dependent city is not the same as being
21:54
carfree the goal isn't to eliminate cars here it's to create an environment where
21:59
people can live without meting one and where residents might even prefer not having a car at all if it's done
22:06
correctly um and a bike master plan goes beyond just adding bike Lanes it's about
22:11
making bik Lan a safe and accessible and viable Choice through infrastructure
22:16
improvements safety measures and long-term planning we're now 8 years out
22:21
from the 2017 City's weekend comprehensive plans which explicitly call for bike infrastructure I'm just
22:28
going to point out a few places where that happens um page 24 uh 2017 comence
22:34
of plan gos Transportation section 5.0 said develop an integrated and efficient
22:39
transportation system to ensure the effective and economic moving of people in Goods within and through be including
22:44
public transportation pedestrian and bicycle systems page 95 letter e
22:50
Transportation goals consider developing bik Lanes on fish Avenue and the conclusion of the plan reinforces this
22:56
need stating there's General support for improved pedestrian and bicycle facilities in the city many residents
23:02
expressed the need for a bicycle plan so we have the opportunity to create a safer more connected and more
23:08
liable Beacon B master plan isn't just a vision it's a necessary step toward a more accessible sustainable and vibrant
23:15
vibrant community and I urge us to take action now to ensure that Beacon's future includes a safe and Equitable
23:21
Transportation option for everyone thank you thank you very
23:26
much our next speaker will be Daniel Daniel you permission to speak whenever you're ready Daniel tell us your last
23:34
name and where you live approximately Daniel VY here um I'm a
23:39
homeowner resident World W one in Beacon uh I'm just speaking tonight Board of
23:45
the proposed uh upper pip Lanes on Fishkill Avenue um and uh I I just think
23:52
I spoken before the council um voicing uh this need for uh more robust
23:58
infrastructure and that Beacon should really make that um you know one of its priorities um and this would be a really
24:06
a great opportunity to to put that into action as we're building on a a major through fair and redesigning uh uh this
24:13
area and seems like it would be a real missed opportunity to not include cycling infrastructure in uh in that
24:21
area um I also wanted to uh voice opposition to uh proposal the alterate
24:27
proposal to add on parking to bille Avenue um just seems like we we've
24:32
already seated so much public space um on the streets to cars already and uh
24:38
that space could go great use for recycling for other uses um so and and
24:45
we could uh seeding that space to cars just seems um confusing to me at best um
24:51
so I'm really in opposition to that and that's all I have to say tonight thank you thank you very much
24:58
and lastly we have ni commission to speak whenever you're ready thank you Ben uh this
25:09
isend um good evening um I would like to
25:15
reiterate um the rquest for full
25:20
meeting and um I really love the advocacy of The Bicycle Coalition and I
25:26
would encourage you to to also advocate for full minutes that reflect in the
25:32
public record the desire of the public to see
25:38
by claim this master plan because otherwise people come here every week
25:44
and if you're not going to watch the meeting you don't know that people come here it should be part of the minute it
25:51
used to be part of the me prior to co and U it's really like a
25:58
that I've all C around the SCH so I would like to St doing the same
26:07
regarding 52 I live right of 52 um I have been in touch with the
26:17
committee but I also wanted to just say here that um it would be great to be
26:24
better um stronger but better I know there's a lot of work that goes into it and I'm very grateful to um present his
26:33
team but stronger enforcement of um um trash removal on 52 where we
26:42
actually have a lot of Walkers like we have a lot of uh people from Hedgewood
26:48
that walk to the dollar store and we have people that come to
26:55
the I don't remember what it's called that they used to be on on Main Street
27:00
uh the clinic so um for the people that are already using 52 that are already
27:07
walking 52 that are using their wheelchairs um they should be respected
27:14
if like there shouldn't be snow on the ground there shouldn't be ice on the ground there shouldn't be trash sh all
27:20
over let's get some trash cans in there um and it's it feels like that's not a
27:27
heavy do that um in terms of walking and biking infrastructure I would love to
27:35
see the madaan path just as a bike and walking path for the kids you could save
27:42
money for the school dist they wouldn't me to give my daughter a bus to the high school because she would have strange
27:48
walking path or kids like her she she's about to graduate but he's there going
27:53
to the middle school as well so um
27:59
thank you so much and I also wanted to say that in terms of the com plan um we shouldn't be trying to solve
28:07
everything before the com plan because we the idea of having like a robust comparing plan is to 15s get good public
28:17
feedback and we don't like Get Enough feedback from people that don't organize
28:24
with certain groups so let's not solve everything as was said here before the
28:29
call thank you so much thank
28:36
you uh Ben more speakers on Zoom okay so
28:41
that's the first opportunity for public comment um there is a second at the tail end of the meeting if you haven't spoken
28:48
at this one um and now let's do a couple of public hearings so the first
28:55
one um is actually there's two public hearings
29:02
concerning property tax exemptions and so um those two hearings um as they are
29:10
on similar topics I'm going to open both of them up uh concurrently and limit the
29:15
speaker's time to 3 minutes combined for the both proposed local laws um so I'm looking for a motion in a
29:23
second that we that we combine those two public hearings second all right so that's Amber and Molly all in favor of
29:30
so doing so say I I all right anyone oppose Thank you Pam I got that so again
29:36
there's two of them one concerns there they both are existing property tax exemptions Nick you're going to tell us
29:42
a little bit more one is for senior citizens and it's income based and the other one is for dis disabled persons
29:48
that's also income based will you give us a brief description Nick before we open it up I will mayor you so the city
29:55
extends real property mayor to one senior citizens a 65 and older with
30:01
limited income set forth in the beacan city code chapter 199 section
30:07
1991 and also to disabled persons with limited incomes in section
30:13
19911 these exemptions are pursued to New York state law and what the city is
30:19
doing with these two local laws is updating the exemption amounts to be consistent with the amounts um offered
30:26
by Dutchess County and in this case it's done on a sliding scale based upon your
30:33
um uh income and it's increasing right now the limitation is um no less than 20
30:41
20,5 50% reduction that's being increase so that those whose annual income is
30:46
41,600 or less get a 50% exemption from
30:51
their set value as allocated against their city taxes only and then the
30:57
exemption saes out to 0% if you earn $50,000 or more and those exemption
31:04
amounts are the same for both the senior citizen and the disabled persons with limited
31:09
income that Mayes a brief summary great thank you Nick um and I just want to put
31:15
into the record apparently I didn't need a motion to open the public hearing but we have one on record I need one to
31:21
close one um so having done said that let's see who's on the list uh to talk
31:27
on the public hearing on tax exemptions I have Teresa craft signed
31:36
up so you combine both right but yeah youve lowered the number of minutes um I
31:42
just want to I know this is part not part of it and I have something for the public hearing but stop interrupting the
31:48
speakers at the podium when they're with that time countdown it's very disruptive to the speaker train of thoughts and it
31:55
takes time you know 15 seconds you're already eating up my 5 Seconds thank you and again I thought the city did not
32:01
vote on public hearing items in the same meeting as a resolution vote so back to the public hearing I'm all for the uh
32:08
supporting the new local law for the uh handicap people with limited incomes
32:15
disability but I regarding the senior citizens uh TX exemptions can this be
32:20
based on the length of residency we are already seeing large numbers of new residents relocating to Beacon from all
32:27
over to cash on the action here I would like to see long-standing residents receive this
32:32
benefit first before it is capped off if there is a limit to the number of allowable applicants to apply either way
32:39
I'd like to see this based on the number of years residing in the city thank you thank you very much anyone else want to
32:46
talk on this public hearing regarding exemptions anyone online Ben yes we do
32:54
have one hand raised on zoom and another the call call your whenever you're ready
32:59
thank you um so I um I'm also in support of this
33:08
um to basically bring the rate the
33:14
exemption limits up today to current um Market um values of income I
33:22
do have a concern that we don't have a good idea of how much money this will
33:29
cost us I so it sounded a little bit hand way me
33:36
in the meeting when um the city employees were talking about it and it
33:43
just gives me concern because when you look at um 2018 Hudson Valley pattern
33:51
for Progress we have we had 43% of our
33:58
um residents making less than $50,000 now we all know that with rapid
34:04
gentrification that has changed a lot in weekend but if I would I know we lost
34:11
the fisal Watch Dog we had on the Cale to GES County but if I was
34:17
physically like watch Tov then I would try to get an estimate of how much this
34:22
would cost and whether we have that money before signing off on this
34:28
again I me support but cautiously thank you thank you very much anyone else
34:36
online no further hands rais on Zoom okay so I will take a motion to close
34:42
these two public hearings motion second so that's Molly and Amber and again these are the
34:49
hearings on exemptions for seniors and disabled and raising the income limits
34:54
all in favor for closing those public hearings say I I anyone opposed Thank
34:59
you Pam okay so the other public hearing is
35:05
for uh the Community Development block grant program I will open the public
35:10
hearing and first ask Chris to just explain briefly to the public what's at for so as we discussed last week we are
35:17
applying for cdbg funding again in 2025 as part of that application we're
35:23
required to hold a public hearing um we're proposing to replace 560 linear
35:29
feet of sidewalk on Walcott Avenue 9d between South Avenue and forestal
35:35
Heights um for an approximate cost of $199,000 um we uh will have to have our
35:43
application in by March 3rd so we're putting plans together we have the
35:48
estimate and one of the other requisite items is a a resolution from the city
35:53
council and this public hearing so you'll see um once we close the public hearing you also have that authorization
36:00
on as number six on the agenda um we also we did publish the um
36:07
eligibility map that you had asked for which is in the packet thank
36:13
you all right so opening the public hearing the first one on the list is Teresa
36:26
Craft um this resolution in its current form may be viewed as lacking
36:31
transparency while updating our infrastructure is essential it does not adequately address the pressing issue of
36:37
moderate to lwi income housing addressed in that Grant improvements to sidewalks
36:42
and other infrastructure will benefit all the residents of Beacon but we need to confront the core issues directly
36:49
affordable housing should be our top priority the state Grant also highlights the importance of public facilities
36:54
housing Rehabilitation and public services we should allocate Grant funds to restore and renovate the old
37:00
firehouses transforming them into valuable public facilities and services
37:05
much of the rehabilitation work may be eligible for grandfathering which could help streamline the process remember how
37:12
much money the city was going to save by rebuilding what is now our Firehouse so let's finish these roads and I know
37:17
we're not going to start any more sidewalks so let's focus on public facilities services and um low income
37:24
and moderate housing thank you thank you very much um Christine are you still
37:37
here um good evening Mr Mayor city council I'm reading for Sergey COV War 3
37:43
who couldn't be here I want to express my support for the city of Beacon pursuing Community Development block
37:50
grant my specific interest would be within public facilities and improvements categories such as repairs
37:58

38:03
friendly features and bus bus shelters to improve pedestrian
38:08
connections improvements to existing facilities Municipal Parks and Recreation areas particularly
38:16
handicapped accessible improvements improvements designed to M
38:22
mate flooding and improve the resiliency of critical infrastructure facilities
38:28

and you'll find their committee link and um also while you're on the city of
46:25
Beacon website there are um there's a link on the homepage for Workforce
46:30
housing afford that's available at several locations so if you think you
46:36
might be eligible for that and in need check that out um also um kind of wanted
46:43
just I wasn't going to say this tonight but there's a few people who said it um that there are possibilities to improve
46:49
our Council minutes any kind of AI help to do that um would be greatly
46:55
appreciated that's that's all I have thank you thanks Pam um I don't have to
47:02
talk about the Elks it's been said three times um our police officers look to um
47:09
especially Dapper at that event uh including lieutenant confield and uh uh
47:14
Chief figlio um the only thing I would add is uh just a point of
47:20
information the I recall the Fishkill Avenue committee discussing the possibility of parking on 52 to uh it
47:27
wasn't at least the discussion I heard was not to supplant bikes but to
47:33
actually U create a barrier between the road and the bikes I believe the section
47:38
that they were discussing was the section where the tracks are directly adjacent to Route 52 given that
47:45
adjacency uh extremely easy to have the bike lanes and the pedestrians on the rail trail put a row of cars in between
47:53
and create that spacing and additional safety so I just wanted to to point that out as a point of information otherwise
48:00
um I'll let it go to the city administrator um I just have two quick
48:05
things Hudson River housing was supposed to come tonight we have rescheduled them um for uh the next voting meeting and we
48:14
announced this last week but I'll remind people we're sending out the second and Final Notice on the water meter
48:20
transmitter upgrades um so you'll if if you haven't already scheduled the upgrade of your transmitter um please do
48:27
reach out to the city the numbers and the website uh link are on our website
48:33
which is Beacon n.gov that's all I have thank you okay all right let's do our resolutions
48:41
um the first one is pointing Anthony Lombardo the possession of police officer uh Chief do you want to come
48:50
up for sure so first thank you guys everybody
48:55
who was able to attend on Saturday that really was lovely um and then uh Lieutenant confield was here on a couple
49:01
of other matters and it was great to have him be able to come up because he's been working very hard for us to get these hires um in the door and processed
49:09
um it's been taking up a tremendous amount of his time so I'm glad he was able to come for this one um so tonight
49:15
I'm very pleased to be um have another candidate here for the position of police officer Anthony Lombardo is 24
49:21
years old he's resided in this area his whole life having been bored and raised just to the south of us in colds spring
49:26
new New York where he attended howan High School anony is currently a police officer with NYPD and prior to that
49:32
worked as a laborer a carpenter and as a foreman for a property management firm he also engaged in significant volunteer
49:38
work in his local community to include organizing meals for homeless shelters and participating in the Polar Plunge to
49:43
raise money for the Special Olympics as with all of our candidates Mr Lombardo passed our background
49:50
check a process which includes interviewing neighbors and Associates checking to the individual's
49:56
Finance and social media checking into their criminal domestic academic and employment history and among other
50:01
things passing a rigorous psychological and polygraph examination we're looking forward to hiring uh Mr Lombardo and
50:08
bringing him on board soon to continue to address our ongoing staffing issues okay any uh comments questions
50:16
from the council not a question but just um
50:23
appreciation that we've had uh several new officers has joined us over the past couple of weeks and I hope that that
50:29
Trend continues and I'm sure you do too yes do I for sure so thank you thank you
50:35
uh to clarify I believe officer Lombardo would be joining us for field training
50:40
if if we approved him more or less right away kind of the timing of that when people might see him out on the streets if you know that yet it it would
50:46
probably be in the next couple of weeks he's currently employed now so he has to give notice to his current job and then
50:51
a little bit great thank you a little L time so okay um I just want to thank the
50:58
chief and Lieutenant confield I know you're working hard at it and uh we look forward to welcoming you aboard but just
51:04
wait a minute um so uh do we we have a motion in a second on this one we don't
51:10
yet can I get a motion in a second motion so that's second Amber and Molly to appoint Anthony Lombardo the position
51:16
of police officer any further discussion all right so all in favor of so doing
51:22
say I I I I heard Pam thank you uh anyone osed look at that okay welcome
51:29
aboard thank you very
51:36
much all right the second one is appointing Corey worthman to the
51:42
position of acting building inspector 2 can I get a motion and a second for
51:47
Corey motion second so that's Amber and Molly um and Chris anything you want to
51:55
add on uh Corey before we go to a vote on that yes um the uh current buildin
52:02
inspector 2 is Bruce flower and he's leaving on Friday uh we have already
52:07
canvased the Civil Service list from Duchess County and we have interviews scheduled for Thursday um and but there
52:15
is going to be a lag time to get someone in so we are proposing to make Corey worthman the acting building inspector
52:23
too Corey had actually done that position over in olster County um is eligible for it and he'll be filling in
52:30
after Bruce leaves on Friday if you approve it okay um I had just wanted
52:36
Clarity on the two part of the building inspector is that because of the level of complexity within the city of Beacon
52:42
I wasn't sure of the full range of options for building inspector the state office it's just the position title in
52:48
Duchess County Civil Service so I don't know if it has to do with the size of the municipality or the level but it's
52:55
it's essentially the the top position in the city thank you yeah and sometimes
53:01
they'll do building inspector is for Town and then building inspector 2 will be for cities um so I they they do
53:10
things that I don't always know the background of Chris can you just clarify how many
53:16
interviews are scheduled for Thursday and how they came about was it like an active
53:21
interest there's a civil service list that we have to go from so there's a test that's administered for this there
53:27
were seven people on the test we sent out canvas what's called a canvas letter to say are you interested we had three
53:35
responses we have done two we'll we'll schedule two interviews out of that one
53:41
we interviewed previously um and I we're not going to interview
53:49
again all right so let's move to a vote unless any other comments uh so all in
53:57
favor of appointing Corey worthman to acting building inspector 2 say I I I
54:04
Thank you Pam uh anyone opposed all right so the third one I'm looking for a motion and a second uh to authorize the
54:12
city administrator to execute a license agreement with Cornell Cooperative educa
54:17
Extension uh regarding the Green Team and their use of the rec center motion
54:23
second so that was um Paloma and Chef um
54:29
and Nick you're going to tell us something about this I am mayor thank you so this as you indicated the license
54:36
agreement with Corel exension in connection with their team program administer in the city and it's a
54:42
license agreement for use of certain Fai in the recreation Cent fail it's for a
54:47
one-year term the agreement provides for four rals and it's for $3,000 a year and
54:55
the agreement is also a to be terminated by the city on 30 days notice and there
55:00
than there's other standard Provisions regarding insurance and indication this is really a Ral of the agreement that
55:08
provides for extensions going into the future all right any comments questions
55:14
by the council I've got a non Secor just to say I appreciate Nick's connection tonight I think he's on his phone it's
55:20
much better than previous so that was an improvement stick with this Nick thank you cool that's a good
55:28
point all right good job Pete so um all in favor of authorizing
55:35
the city administrat execute a license agreement with Cornell Cooperative Extension say I I I all right I heard
55:42
Pam thank you very much anyone opposed all right um let's do uh four
55:48
and five separately so the first one is a resolution uh um raising the limits for
55:55
property tax exemptions for senior citizens can I get a motion in a second motion second so that's Molly and Amber
56:03
Nick anything you would add that we didn't discuss in the public hearing opening um nothing you one comment with
56:11
respect to a potential modification from a revenue but New York State not permit that to be offered to some but not
56:17
everyone need be offered to everyone on the same basis regard I
56:22
appre yeah I appreciate you saying that um the other question that I heard um
56:28
was what's the financial impact of this um I don't know the answer to that and I I don't like doing stuff I don't know
56:34
the answer to but I can I can tell you from experience it's an extremely small
56:39
number right so it doesn't tend to be a large number of exemptions my understanding too from conversations
56:46
when um Kathy our tax assessor was here was that our total tax space stays the
56:51
same but depending how many people qualify how we divide that up changes is that accurate or we'd actually get less
56:57
money in no so the the levy is the levy so when we approve a budget there's a
57:04
total bill that's called The Levy that's around 134 million and then it's just a
57:09
question of How It's divied up right and so if there's 100 properties and two of
57:15
them are only taxed at half the rate that means you effectively have 99
57:21
properties and all of the properties get 100 over 99 uh their share of that U no I'm sorry
57:29
one over uh see if I get this right one over 99 yeah that's right as opposed to
57:34
one over 100 right so it's it's divied up amongst the rest of the community for a slightly greater amount that is not
57:41
collected from those taxpayers thank you for clarifying yeah the one thing um that I wanted to
57:50
ask do we know if duess county is going to be increasing this amount because um
57:58
the state has it where the sliding can scale or can go up to I guess it's like
58:07
57,500 however it just so happened I got two property tax exemption information
58:16
postcards in the mail today one for fish kill property and one for Beacon
58:21
property and they're both pretty much exactly the same and they're saying that
58:26
could be not to exceed 58,4 so I'm not sure it does say there
58:33
is an aster saying maybe lower depending on the municipality and the school district but I'm wondering if we can
58:40
find out from the county before we vote on this if they are considering raising
58:46
their figure before we lock into this amount and it it's not their current one
58:53
if we want to stay on Pace with the county
58:59
I don't know what current are but they did update and I believe that was a year ago when pursu changes and say well they
59:05
updated to what it Curr but I can't speak to what they may or may not do in the
59:11
future okay and and the intent of this Pam was to bring this into um
59:17
conformance with their their rate and I understand that school district may be looking to raise theirs CU their
59:23
threshold is now below ours or would be below ours it's it's just it's helpful
59:29
when all the taxing jurisdictions pick the same number and I wouldn't expect after just a year that they would update
59:36
it again okay because it just seemed like the state it may have increased in a
59:42
year's time CU I was looking at the form that's involved in applying and it's a
59:51
little actually I guess it does have a 5,400 on there but yeah we're just less
59:57
than that yeah there's there's a higher tier and the county chose to go to the second highest tier so we're just
1:00:04
matching that and mayor could I just clarify um
1:00:10
maybe a little bit further what what Molly was asking and and the example that you gave so it's you know looking
1:00:17
at the table the the most that somebody would be exempt from their assessment would be half of it so it wouldn't even
1:00:24
be that full one that would need to be distributed it would be like a fraction
1:00:29
of a percentage of like in some cases it could be like 05% that's a that's like like right it's
1:00:37
not it's a sliding it's not like people are not paying any taxes at all there's a it's a sliding scale of the exemption
1:00:43
and and so the distribution is as you mentioned fairly light when you start to break into the percentages yeah I
1:00:48
appreciate you pointing that out I used a very simple example which was probably for the best right I only picked 100
1:00:55
taxpayers two that had the exemption and both read the 50% but as you correctly say that's the maximum and in fact the
1:01:02
likely average is somewhere south of that right and mayor I have some
1:01:07
additional information I looked at the county tax code they adopted their law
1:01:12
May of 23 and their law provides that effect of March 1st 2025 their income limit
1:01:20
increase to what the city would be adopted so it will be exactly consistent with um the city and the county yeah I
1:01:27
found the same thing on their ecode so thanks for confirming Nick
1:01:33
right so the only other thing I would request and Chris if you could pass this along is to ask our assessor to keep
1:01:39
track of where the county and the school district are and to update us when there might be changes um the other thing is
1:01:46
I'm pretty sure that the assessor can also tell us the current impact of the current rates on our assessment not the
1:01:53
new ones but the current one because it's very straightforward to say this is the total tax base excluding exemptions
1:02:02
and this is the tax base including those exemptions so she has that data available if she could forward that to
1:02:07
the council somewhere along the way that'd be great and just one clarification when
1:02:13
that school district does not except the um exemptions to senior citizens with limited
1:02:19
incomes or for the disabled person's exemption it's just the counting in the
1:02:24
city so that means it affects only the bill that goes out that just went out right the the county and City Bill and
1:02:31
not the school district and Library Bill correct okay thank you
1:02:37
Nick since we're talking about timing I also wanted to point out that you will apply for this exemption before the end
1:02:43
of the month but it won't affect your current bill it will affect your following tax bill 2026 2026 tax bill
1:02:51
right well if you if you have the current if you've already applied for it you'll get the exemption at the lower
1:02:57
rate the current rate and then if you haven't applied you'll get it at the new rate in the next bill yes yeah thank you
1:03:03
so much that's great information and and how are we defining seniors is that 65
1:03:08
it correct yes
1:03:14
okay all right any other questions on this or comments the only thing I was
1:03:19
wondering is this something that could be put on the board of assessment um
1:03:26
page like easier to find this I mean I don't know if that's possible it was not
1:03:32
that easy to find I know on this postcard it's saying
1:03:40
contact the local assessor and it does have Kathy Martin's um address you know
1:03:45
work address and City phone
1:03:51
number yeah we already have a resources section of that page so this could be added we can add
1:03:58
it thanks Pam that great okay are we all
1:04:05
set all right so all in favor of adopting uh local law number one concerning property tax exemptions for
1:04:12
senior citizens say I I I and I heard Pam anyone opposed all right so that's
1:04:19
unanimous and then the second one is uh the same law but for disabled persons
1:04:24
with limited income motion so that's Amber second and Paloma any further
1:04:30
discussion on this other than what we learned in the first one so the same
1:04:35
would apply what you described with the levy and the applicability to how it would work if someone qualified for this
1:04:40
that's right um and I'll go looking when we see our next budget for those dollar amount differences um yeah they do
1:04:48
appear so and and it's literally because of this okay so um all in favor corre
1:04:56
just Molly didn't catch this some surprise but on page 16 of the packet after 50,000 you need or more added to
1:05:08
that you we make that weend correct
1:05:15
that okay thank you for pointing that out all right all in favor of adopting local law
1:05:23
2 concerning property tax exemptions for disabled persons with limited income say I I I and I heard Pam anyone
1:05:32
opposed okay that passes unanimously and the last resolution is authorizing uh an
1:05:38
application for the community block development grant for 2025 can I get a
1:05:43
motion and a second motion second so uh Paloma and Molly and this we have the
1:05:51
public hearing on so Chris there isn't much more to add right I don't okay so
1:05:57
this is the dollar amount is approximately $199 is that what we're and that um the reason we're aiming for
1:06:04
that amount is we usually get an allocation right around 200,000 so it it's not like we can apply
1:06:11
for housing and get $2 million it or are we're limited to
1:06:17
$200,000 and that's why we try to choose a segment of sidewalk that's in a lowincome neighborhood again we've been
1:06:24
rebuilding South Avenue West Center Street and both sides of South Avenue and now are moving around
1:06:30
the corner to wott um so we have to pick an area within the eligible areas on the
1:06:35
map that's in the packet okay all right any other comments on
1:06:41
this one um I'll just say that I I did appreciate the the comments and the
1:06:47
sentiment of the comments in the public hearing at the same time that I do think that this is the right project to move
1:06:53
forward with this round of the cdb Grant um but I'll note that I I hope that the
1:07:00
workshop conversation that we started to preview last week in listing out all of the city's major projects um and
1:07:07
potentially including a sidewalk plan of sorts will mean that as these Grant
1:07:12
Cycles come forward into the future there's going to be greater transparency about what the city is considering and
1:07:18
also potentially more robust discussion about each of those projects as they're sort of queued up um but I'm I'm I'm
1:07:25
fully in support of of this grant um and moving forward with this right now I'll add that I appreciate the map
1:07:32
that you added this time Chris and Ben kind of playing that out I think we've talked about those areas of Eligibility
1:07:38
before so seeing it out um I also say that it's great that you've teed up these projects because I believe at
1:07:43
least the past couple of years the timing of when these this funding was was actually published made it
1:07:49
challenging for lots of other places who essentially didn't apply for anything at all because they didn't it just was such a quick turnaround so the fact that you
1:07:56
and Ben and the city staff have been able to to turn around on these and get funding for these pieces of infrastructure is great thanks and I I
1:08:03
would thank the city engineer John Russo that he's the key thank you for naming him specifically um yeah the only thing
1:08:10
I would add is um the the use of these funds for capital projects means that
1:08:16
the impact of those dollars lasts for years and years and years and I think that's why it's um the appropriate thing
1:08:23
to do okay uh all in favor of uh authorizing an application for the 2025
1:08:31
cdbg grant funding say I I I and I heard Pam anyone opposed all right that passes
1:08:38
unanimously I am now looking for a motion and a second to approve the minutes of January 21st motion second uh
1:08:46
so that was uh Molly and Paloma uh good night
1:08:52
Chef as always thank you for being here ating things to say that he's just going to miss now all right so now is the time
1:08:59
to have that discussion on minutes that just the paper's going to miss what do we got I don't I don't actually have one
1:09:05
this time but it's the theory behind it so all right all all in favor of
1:09:11
approving the minutes of January 21 say I I I any anyone opposed and I did hear
1:09:17
Pam okay this is the second opportunity for public comment uh if you did not
1:09:23
speak at the first one and would like to do so now this is your opportunity I don't see anyone in the physical crowd
