going to try to keep it to 10 minutes some of the slides I'm just going to go through quickly because not everything
4:23
we do at the Department of Mental Health is accessible to everyone so those things I'm just going to go over very
4:29
quickly um next slide please so this is a very busy slide with
4:35
a lot of words um and I would not expect you to even be able to see what the words are so I'll just start by
4:43
saying we try to conceive a Continuum of Care that encompasses prevention
4:50
recovery outpatient services um and inpatient services and
4:55
we're responsible for sort of seeing that overall Continuum of Care for both Youth and adults in Duchess County and
5:02
that's mental health substance use services for adults and children what you're seeing on this
5:08
slide is uh all of the Community Partners that we have that help us accomplish this goal so we partner with
5:15
approximately 35 different agencies um and those folks help us
5:20
deliver these Services we also deliver Services ourselves and I'm just going to touch on some of them this evening next
5:27
slide please so the first thing I would want to cover is the thing that everyone should know
5:34
about and should be um really in everybody's toolbox and that is our 988
5:39
crisis hotline so Duchess County has a longstanding history of a 24-hour uh uh
5:47
helpline this is now called the 988 hotline which is uh Nationwide and we
5:54
answer the 988 calls for Duchess County olster County and Sullivan County this
5:59
is uh 24 access to mental health professionals any day of the
6:05
year um those folks can also connect individuals to uh the stabilization
6:11
Center and our mobile crisis intervention team so you think of them as sort of a triage for um any Mental
6:18
Health crisis next slide please this is the the crisis
6:25
stabilization Center this is also a 24-hour operation it is now currently
6:30
licensed and operated by people USA which is a community- based organization uh it's a 24-hour facility it is open to
6:38
anyone um and you can just walk in and get immediate assistance this is located
6:43
at 230 North Road in pipy um for those who aren't familiar with where that is it's basically right across the street
6:50
from what used to be St Francis Hospital and now is Mid Hudson Regional Hospital uh all ages we have law enforcement
6:57
dropping folks off there all the time we use that as an alternative to going to the emergency room for non-im minent
7:04
situations um and we see a lot of children under the age of 18 there we also see a lot of adults you see people
7:10
with mental health and substance use issues on next slide
7:16
please The Duchess County Empowerment Center is a newer initiative um it's
7:21
also located at 230 North Road in pipy and this Center is uh run by people in
7:28
recovery so this is AER Center for individuals who are struggling with a mental health or substance use challenge
7:34
who are interested in receiving care or support from an individual who has lived experience so these are recovery coaches
7:42
um and they are available to meet with individuals either by appointment or during our walk-in hours they also do
7:49
Street Outreach so several week times a week they go out and do Outreach into um
7:55
various places uh places that we know from data are considered you know like a
8:00
hot spot for a place that needs support next slide
8:08
please our trauma team is a team of Seasons mental health professionals who
8:14
can respond to community trauma so if there is a large impact event in a
8:19
community uh for example um a a fire a natural disaster a death of an
8:26
Unexpected death in a community that impacts a lot of people um some other type of larger scale trauma where
8:33
there's a big impact for folks uh the trauma team can come out and uh meet with individuals and give them
8:41
support that can be accessed uh by calling the 988 hotline they dispatch us
8:48
okay next slide please our partial hospitalization
8:53
program is actually one of the programs that's uh run by the county and um
8:58
partial hosit hospital is really an intensive Day program for people with
9:03
acute psychiatric issues for folks that probably have either been in patient
9:10
hospitalization before or are coming out of the hospital and are requiring some stepdown care um there's a youth version
9:18
that is run by Aster services and then there is an adult version that is uh run by Duchess
9:24
County next slide please we also offer forensic evaluation
9:30
services and supports in The Duchess County Jail um there's a treatment unit
9:36
in The Duchess County jail for people with substance use disorder called restart um we do forensic evaluations
9:43
these are court-ordered forensic evaluations for both competency and for
9:48
treatment recommendation for folks um we oversee the medication assisted
9:54
treatment program at The Duchess County jail for people with opioid use disorder
10:00
um and we also facilitate peer Services peer recovery support services for
10:06
individuals at The Duchess County Jail um we also just quickly we we do
10:12
also run at 230 North Road an alternative to incarceration substance ed treatment program many of those folks
10:19
are come to us through a felony drug court and so they come to us for treatment rather than uh being
10:27
incarcerated and they usually stay with us for about 8 or nine months while living in some type of supported or
10:32
supervised housing environment next slide please the county has multiple um
10:41
outpatient mental health opportunities for both children and
10:46
adults um they and I'm looking at the clock and I see it's already 10 after 7 so I talk faster uh we have uh various
10:55
Youth Clinics across the entire County and Clinics for adults across the
11:01
county next slide please same thing as with our outpatient
11:07
mental health we also have outpatient substance use uh these are some of the places you can receive those
11:15
Services um we have methodone Services um outpatient various levels and uh
11:22
intensities of outpatient substan use across the county as well next slide please
11:29
uh actually covered a lot of this already but I will emphasize on this slide that we do a lot of training for
11:35
the community as well Mental Health First St is a very popular one um and we offer that training for uh for anybody
11:42
who's interested in taking it we can get that set up Naran training is also very popular so we do a lot of uh training
11:49
Crisis Intervention training for law enforcement uh those are some of the the trainings that we offer and are um also
11:55
helpful in just prevention um and just learning about the resources next slide
12:01
please um very quickly assisted out patient treatment is Court mandated
12:06
mental health treatment this is something that is only um for people who meet very specific
12:12
criteria uh you can read more about that um but we have in Duchess County about
12:18
70 people who are um receiving this support next slide
12:24
please so quickly I know um you're very interested in learning about housing I
12:29
will just Sabrina is going to talk a little bit more about this but I wanted to say something about single point of
12:35
access which is also known as spoa there's a children's spa and there's an adults boa for adults boa it uh connects
12:44
individuals with a serious mental illness and again only for people who qualify so there's an application
12:52
process but an application would come into the spoa coordinator and then that would help
12:58
facilitate some type of supported housing for individuals with serious mental illness there's three different
13:04
levels of housing um ranging from you know living in an independent apartment
13:09
with a case manager who visits with you once a month to living in U more of a
13:15
kind of a residence a community residence where you're with other individuals and you have 24-hour uh
13:21
staff support um children's single point of access or children's spoa or C spoa
13:27
as you might hear it has a whole other range of services available for children
13:32
uh who have a serious mental health condition and also family supports through that process but those are
13:38
applications that have to be filed those applications are available on the County website and um you can read about the
13:44
criteria there as well next slide please all abilities uh you may have
13:51
seen on the buses uh around town think differently that's been around this is actually the 10y year anniversary of
13:57
think differently um we do a lot in terms of making the community accessible for people of all
14:04
abilities uh there's a lot if actually the think differently website has a ton of resources on it too so if you uh you
14:10
or anybody you know is looking for resources for people on the autism spectrum or any any varying kind of
14:15
ability there's a lot of resources there next slide please um you can of course we have a QR
14:23
code because who doesn't have a QR code if you scan that QR code it will bring you to our glorious app that has a ton
14:30
of resources on it and is updated regularly you can find links and maps
14:35
and all sorts of other things to every resource and more that I talked about tonight um I would also encourage you to
14:41
visit our website there's a lot more information and this is a very abbreviated version of the presentation
14:46
so if anybody has uh questions I think we'll take questions after Sabrina goes and then um you know I'm also happy to
14:53
talk more um if you're interested and you want to give me a call or whatever so uh I think that is the the last slide
15:00
maybe some more resources so I can give these slides to you too so you have these are all clickable resources here
15:05
so there's some interesting information in addition to what I talked about um this evening as well as some of our
15:11
partners uh the websites of some of our community based partners that deliver services and I think that's the last
15:19
one yes thank you not too bad just
15:24
[Music] slightly that was great um as you said
15:29
um we'll do Sabrina and then we'll do questions collectively is that all right sounds good to me okay so um Sabrina
15:37
marzuka is the uh Commissioner of community and Family Services she's been
15:43
doing this a long time uh in the county right um I'm still standing yeah and um
15:50
um Sabrina's got a masters in public health and a law degree too um and um
15:57
you know so she's here to talk both about housing which we asked about which is what I what prompted me to reach out
16:03
but also all of the services that you offer so don't don't you know limit yourself all right so thank you for
16:09
coming thank you I appreciate the opportunity so um I'm going to do like
16:15
really briefly an overview of everything that's available at our department um
16:21
but I'll spend a lot more time about housing because that that was the interest right so um next slide please
16:28
the public assistance so I I like to say we have two legs one that is financial assistance and and that really covers
16:35
Medicaid like the traditional social services DSS type Services right it's
16:41
it's Medicaid um daycare subsidies temporary assistance including emergency
16:47
housing um the snap program used to be called food stamp which is the supplemental nutrition and uh for those
16:54
of you who don't know we also do Indigent burials so I like to say I cover everything from birth to death so
17:02
pretty much um next slide please the other leg of the department is what I call preventive and protective services
17:09
and and that is really encompassing of children both children and adult so we
17:15
are responsible for a comprehensive planning for youth um up to age 21 and
17:23
we obviously um also provide services to individual who need support for
17:28
collecting Child Care um child support and obviously we investigate and also um
17:36
serve any child who may find thems in an abusive situation and that's that's the
17:42
CPS I mean it's known as CPS but um what what it really is is really the
17:48
protection and the strengthening of families to ensure safety and growth of all children so obviously within that
17:54
you have CPS and Foster Care as well as preventive services and then we on the
17:59
adult side it's similar it's called Adult Protective Services but again same concept anyone who is over 18 unable to
18:07
take care of thems or find thems in an abusive situation that's a CP that's an APS report and we step in APS is
18:14
completely voluntary um that's something that the public usually you know somebody will call and say hey my
18:19
neighbor needs this this and that I've no this X Y and Z and we will go and notice maybe the same things but the
18:27
person if they are insane you know completely in in their mind set and capable of making their own decision and
18:33
unwilling to receive the assistance we cannot force our self and um next
18:39
slide uh quickly when we talk about temporary uh and emergency assistance
18:44
there are really two aspect to the financial support that's offered one is referred to technically as ta you'll
18:51
hear people say I'm on ta that's temporary assistance that includes both family assistance which is federally
18:57
funded 100% and then safety net assistance which is a shared cost
19:02
between the state and the local unfortunately 71% local um so federal
19:08
assistance is only for five years and that's lifetime five years so if you've
19:14
exhausted the Lifetime 5year Assistance you'll become a safety neter right um
19:20
the other side of it is the emergency assistance and we refer to it as EA the emergency assistance there's emergency
19:27
assistance for family and also also emergency assistance for singles right next slide please the application
19:33
process is really cumbersome unfortunately we have no control over that these are federal application
19:40
processes um but what we've done is Tred to make it as accessible as possible so
19:46
um you can go online at my benefit. goov and you can assess whether or not you
19:51
would be eligible you answer a few question and that that pretty much covers mostly snap a little bit of
19:57
Medicaid all of applications are also online we have three offices pipy
20:03
milbrook and Beacon or Beacon office is right on Main Street and uh Beacon
20:08
really focuses on Snap that's that's my snap team however you can drop off application for any other services and
20:15
we can also arrange for interview so you don't have to drive all the way to um pipy if you have to um and finally you
20:22
can do um you can drop off documents like I said you can we have an app because we're trying to be the 21st
20:29
century and you can drop off your document the app is free it's on our website and so people can download it
20:35
and on their phone take a picture upload the document and submit without having to come in person and obviously you can
20:42
fax and you can mail the oldfashioned way and finally um which is really important we've really diminished the
20:49
requirement for face-to-face interviews so we can do a lot of interviews on the
20:55
phone uh except for emergencies emergencies we really we need to see you face to face so next slide please so I'm
21:03
going to jump right into housing assistance that was a quick overview of all of our services I don't expect you
21:10
to remember most of it but you can always refer back to it so our our
21:16
housing assistance is really comprehensive and I just bullet for you sort of like the the general topic and
21:22
I'll I'll try to go into details for most of them so obviously all of our services involve some level of case man
21:28
management emergency housing is really considered temporary housing assistance that's thha but we also have other type
21:35
of resources for emergency housing we do a lot of eviction prevention because the goal for emergency housing and for
21:41
housing in general is to prevent homelessness so there's a lot of activity around infection prevention a
21:49
lot of information and referral uh we also serve as a domestic uh violence
21:54
leason so if somebody's in need of DV shelter um it's sort of kind of goes
21:59
through US many a time and we also have something that's unique in duess County
22:04
I think because not every county has it it's family and adult foster family kind of taking the same concept of foster
22:10
care for children and we've adopted and done something similar for adults she's pretty cool next slide
22:18
please so I I I'll skip over this one because I'm sure you can list 50 other
22:23
reason why people people become homeless and why we have such a homeless um situation but it is a complex issue and
22:29
it is a nationwide issue and all of those bullet are shared by pretty much everyone next
22:35
Slide the common request that we get when people come into our office looking for housing assistance It's usually the
22:42
first month rent um security deposit lots of rental rear problems
22:50
particularly recently um ongoing cash assistance because they can't afford it
22:55
emergency shelter because they are literally homeless as they come in and then obviously um we have multiple way
23:02
of of handling the homeless and I'll go into more um into that but I just wanted
23:07
you to know most of what are most common requests that we see next slide please
23:13
so as I mentioned the key is homeless prevention and there are a variety of programs that we do in Duchess County
23:19
specifically geared towards homeless prevention we have a contract with United Way 211 so when you call 211 you
23:27
can determine you I think you I believe you press seven uh in the menu and you will get connected to somebody who is
23:33
specifically trained for Duchess County what we do is we do an assessment of all available resources for housing and
23:40
homelessness then they will go through a pre-screening and then give you multiple referral as to where you might be
23:47
eligible there are a lot of agencies that provide support besides our agency
23:52
uh some of them are small not for-profits um like Catholic Charities offer some you know and there are other
23:58
Foundation Pati who have small little pockets and so we go first through that screening so that we divert as many as
24:04
we can outside of our system before they can we are last resort the other um thing that we do is our shelter um
24:12
diversion we call it shelter diversion when you call us we try to CU you're in a crisis typically you can't think
24:18
straight right it's just everything is just happening to you and you are you're you're literally in in a crisis
24:25
situation and and we sit down with you and you try to help you think through what resources you may have perhaps you
24:33
have a family member who might be willing to take you on for a couple of days perhaps you have other resources
24:38
and Friends where you could go and stay for a couple of days or a couple of weeks we will make those phone calls we
24:44
will ask you those question we will make those phone calls with you and see if people are are willing or able to assist
24:49
you and that allows us to avoid and divert you while we still apply you can still apply and go through the process
24:57
but you don't necessarily need to have a shelter as an emergency shelter you could go to your friend your mother your
25:03
mom you know anybody that can be a resource for you while we can help you find an apartment long term um so the
25:10
diversion program works really really well and it also um you know we have
25:16
what I call what I love to refer to as my hot team they're really hot and what they really are is Outreach it's it's a
25:23
homeless Outreach um program and there are many I call Jun Marie because um
25:29
there were so many grants and so many activities going on on Street Outreach some were some were not necessarily for
25:35
homeless specifically we have a street Outreach specific to homeless but Jin Marie had some Outreach that were around
25:41
diversion uh like police diversion uh other outreach program that you may be familiar with like the beat um that in
25:49
pipy I don't know if they have it in Beacon but I thought maybe you did where police officers go out once or twice a
25:55
week with some Mental Health Providers and try to sort of Outreach individuals in the streets so our our idea was we're
26:03
all on the streets we're probably seeing the same people so we get together and we discuss and we we try to make sure we
26:10
are not duplicating Services we're maximizing and the key in in Outreach
26:16
and sweet Outreach is engagement and I might reach out to you and it didn't work out but Jin Marie reaches out to
26:22
you and it does work out so we exchange information and we do a lot of that coordination in order to make sure that
26:28
we are trying all avenues in engaging these individuals while they are on the streets um to try to bring them into
26:35
care so we're very proud of our hot team next step next slide please um so I
26:43
talked about the fact that we people come in a lot for rental reers and that's part of our um maybe biggest
26:50
request that we receive particularly after covid as you know during covid there was this halt if you may on
26:57
eviction right since that was lifted we've seen more evictions I mean that
27:03
that's just landlords are increasing their their their rent um individuals aren able to pay they can't sustain it
27:11
or they have rental rear that they didn't pay so at some point in time during covid the state had a program
27:16
called erra which was a rental area program that program closed in terms of
27:22
receiving application but I will just let you know that they are still paying off Europe believe it or not so when
27:28
somebody comes to us we check the ER registry just to make sure that this is not someone who's just pending um
27:35
payment and we make the phone call to the landlord as necessary but more than that um the key for the rental
27:43
assistance program with with the federal government dollars that we have is that there are some limitation so I I cannot
27:51
pay more than six month back rent and number two I have to make sure that you can afford it moving forward
27:59
and a lot of time people will come to us and unfortunately moving forward they cannot afford it so if we pay the back
28:05
rent it's not really going to help and they're still going to become unfortunately homeless um thankfully the
28:12
the state came up with this new program called safe seaf and that program
28:18
actually uh allows us to sort of turn a BL eye on the prospective rent um we
28:25
have mixed feelings about this program I've used it mostly for individual who are fully eligible but who may probably
28:32
be able to get a supplement from us and be able to moving forward continue to uh
28:38
sustain with some additional cash assistance but again if you can avoid
28:44
eviction you should do it right otherwise you're just creating more and more um homeless people and it's really
28:50
really hard when they lose that home to find another one that they can afford so
28:56
um that's probably the bulk of for um preventive program it's really the rental assistance um we also do security
29:03
deposits um a lot of people will come and say hey I finally found a place um
29:09
but they want a security deposit and first month rent and I just don't have enough I may have the first month rent
29:14
but not the security or vice versa and so that that's another way for us to help them move out of homelessness and
29:20
pay that that rental all of these programs are income based there are two criterias that have to keep to be kept
29:27
in mind one you're literally homeless people will come to us with a letter
29:32
saying you know you have 10 days blah blah blah you're not homeless you still have 10 days I know it sounds harsh but
29:40
that's unfortunately our our reality so we're like okay you got 10 days to find another resource the diversion program
29:47
you know and all that stuff but the day you find yourself literally homeless is the day the application process starts
29:53
and where we can make a placement an actual emergency placement for you um
29:59
all of these program like I say are eligibility requirement are established for us we don't make the rules I tell
30:05
people all the time I wish I made them but I don't um however the
30:10
the sometimes you will have someone who just makes a little too much money and
30:16
it's it it hurts us I mean it pains us more than it than than people realize because we can't help you because you
30:22
didn't meet the eligibility criteria however if you're literally homeless
30:28
will take you in anyway because you have no shelter that's a different category so it's very complex world and people
30:35
sometime get out confused how can you how come you didn't help me yesterday but you're helping me today well
30:40
yesterday you were not eligible because physically you were not yet homeless and you make a little too much money even
30:46
though it's not enough but it's over the 200% poverty level federal poverty level
30:52
but today even though you still make too much you're physically homeless so I can
30:57
place you go figure um next slide
31:02
please just to give you a sense of what I'm talking about this is the month the current monthly allowance I like to tell
31:09
people you have to work hard to be poor this is how much money I can
31:15
provide with the federal dollars for a single individual for example it's 212
31:22
$216 if they have no children go find rent for $216
31:28
right it's really hard so again that's just to give you a quick Glimpse as the
31:33
difficult situation that we find oursel in and what we've done um to address this because again we know full well
31:41
that that's not going to be sufficient so let's say you work and you make $400 a week um after tax that's probably 300
31:51
and now I'm giving you 200 a month find rent pay all your bills it's you're not
31:56
going to make it right because we know an apartment alone can be 800 or a little single teeny tiny place so next
32:04
slide one of the thing that we've worked on um and I did that back in
32:09
201 17 I believe I applied to the state for what I call the waiver for single
32:15
singles and families to basically say listen your 260 is not going to cut it we should meet at least 85% of the
32:22
market um market rate and so if you give me a supplement to meet that market rate
32:29
I might be able to move people out of emergency shelter because it's actually saving us money if we can do that
32:35
because the emergency shelter is way more expensive right and we were approved thank God and so a lot of our
32:42
individuals that we are assisting right now are receiving ta but they also
32:47
receiving the supplement in order to be able to stay where they're at um and
32:52
then um the state came up uh last year with their own rental supplement program
32:58
because they figured oh that's a smart thing to do maybe we should do it too their supplement program is slightly
33:04
different than ours in that it doesn't require ta eligibility um and it also um you know
33:14
the client must pay 30% towards their rent so it's a little bit different but it's still something that we can help
33:21
because sometime we have someone who's not eligible for ta but we could assist I discussed this earlier so they would
33:27
they would be a to Avail themselves of the rental supplement right now the RSP program is helping about 45 household in
33:34
duess County we have over 200 applications for that
33:40
program um next slide I know it's a lot but I'll do my
33:46
best um so the housing Consortium is important to understand because I tell
33:51
people you know you have to think about it as like a a path right you have the emergency you you might come in under
33:58
emergency because you have zero shelter transitional housing is more of a 2-year time it's a it's a shorter period of of
34:04
time where you're receiving some support and some assistance but ideally we want to put you into a permanent permanent
34:11
housing right where you're you're on your own however there are individual who will continue to need support so the
34:17
permanent Supportive Housing some of it is what Jin Marie talked about in terms of the SPO they have mental health and
34:22
they need ongoing support um that's a permanent Supportive Housing um um and
34:28
then subsidize housing like Section 8 that's a whole other area and some other housing as well so just to give you a
34:35
sense in Duchess County we have a Continuum of Care um it's called the COC
34:40
and all service providers meet regularly and we have a housing plan which is on our County website and it's the plan to
34:48
address housing and homelessness in duess County uh for the next 5 years we are actually in the process of doing it
34:56
again next slide so emergency assistance as I say that's
35:02
that's the busiest uh in terms of Crisis oriented um just to give you a sense of
35:09
where where are our emergency shelter we work primarily with three main service providers in Duchess County Chi Pathways
35:16
and Hudson River housing they are main providers um we also work a lot with
35:22
hotels and motels there is a domestic violence shelter and there is a small little program for Veterans as well so
35:28
I've kind of listed them all and I've I've put for you sort of like the number of units that are available um in each
35:36
of those facility the largest one really um is is with the pods the pods are
35:44
singles and they were created back during covid because we had an influx
35:49
and we couldn't we couldn't maintaining the program the small program that we had first because of the number but also
35:56
simply because we needed the the distance the six feet social um distancing so the pods were temporary
36:02
shelters temporary shelter for the jail when when the when the criminal justice Council um project was launched and we
36:09
were actually building the oh what is it called again Justice
36:15
Center the uh inmates stayed at the Pod for a little while so this is not a structure that was made to leave and to
36:22
last more than 10 years I believe we are on year eight um but since it was sitting there and not being used we were
36:28
able to utilize it and we are utilizing it used to be 150 we've shrinked it down
36:33
to 100 uh it's mostly single and it's right in the city of pyy um Cod
36:40
blue there is such a thing called uh Cod blue which is a requirement that
36:46
Counties have to shelter individuals regardless no questions asked regardless of any income any citizenship any
36:54
anything you it's it's cold we don't want you to freeze to death uh and we
37:00
have an obligation to shelter you so what we've done in Duchess County is warming centers because you know again
37:06
our shelters are pretty book right now and so it is almost impossible for us to
37:12
redefine a more um like a certified shelter space so during CBL we have
37:17
warming centers that are open we work with Christ Church in ppy um and we
37:23
utilize the puds a little bit uh there are other small little church churches that are have very small little pockets
37:30
of warming Center uh up north I believe there is one that has about four or five beds you know very small but the
37:36
churches have played a significant role this year in helping us with warming centers during Cod blue um and then we
37:43
utilize obviously hotels and motels when we are at capacity because there's no other option available so next
37:52
please um so for families we cannot mix families and singles there's a lot of
37:58
Regulation about families and singles so for families we have Hudson River Housing and Community Housing Innovation
38:04
once they are full we have to go to hotels families in hotels is not our favorite it's actually pretty difficult
38:11
because you can only put so many people in a room and there are requirements as square footage per person so that means
38:18
I'm taking more than one room and I want connecting room and um but we do it
38:23
because we have to we usually have during Cod blue about 10 families in hotels um and then the single and adults are
38:30
you know again those those uh providers that I mentioned earlier um which again
38:36
total number of homelessness in Duchess County uh has not moved much um and I
38:41
think partly because of our eviction prevention programs um but it's about 600 individual at any point in time that
38:49
we are serving next slide so transitional housing I
38:54
mentioned is sort of like a um not an emergency housing but not yet permanent
39:00
housing it's like a stepping into that direction uh and these are the uh providers that we have in the number of
39:06
beds that we have it's low barrier um but again uh we use a um the C so we we
39:13
try to what we try to do with the Continuum of Care is we try to have everyone apply through the same uh
39:21
process so it's a single point of entry that's the spoa that Jin Marie was talking about this way we can can make
39:28
sure that the most vulnerable are served first right it's a way to prioritize the
39:34
the placements next steps next slide please um permanent Supportive Housing
39:40
again it's the coordinated entry um it's a it's a lower um threshold if you may
39:47
and um there are priorities that are given really for
39:52
those who are most vulnerable next slide
39:57
and subsidize housing I mean again I I I'm not sure and I I didn't get and I apologize because I didn't get a chance
40:04
to double check this morning um but patstone covers all of Duchess County
40:09
then there is city of pipy city of Beacon but patstone I I believe is not accepting any application right at least
40:16
they weren't like last month I didn't double check yet um but again they were pretty they their their vouchers were
40:23
pretty much at at at capacity we have a special project with uh patstone which
40:28
is uh separate vouchers for foster youth um that's not in the slide but I'm aware of it and we have placed about 14 Foster
40:36
youth as they come out of foster care they have they have vouchers that are reserved for foster youth which is also
40:41
a very important uh aspect I didn't mention it but again uh we work with Hudson River housing and we have River
40:49
Haven which is a runaway and homeless Youth Shelter um that again focuses specifically on Youth and homelessness
40:57
for that particular group and we're talking younger younger individuals
41:02
between uh really 16 to 21 um that is a crucial program as well that that helps
41:09
us in in addressing that particular population next slide so I talked to you about the the
41:17
uniqueness of Duchess County we have two other housing type program the family type home and the foster care family
41:22
home and again these are unique uh small uh but we utilize them because we think
41:29
it also helps particularly people who are in APS on Adult Protective Services who need a little more support um others
41:36
are you know again through the lerant care um we we contract with them so that they can assist us through that process
41:43
we do do annual inspections um but again these are unique programs that we utilize and it's it helps every little
41:50
bit helps next slide please um so again we are open for
41:56
questions these are all the different ways you can find more information we do have a lot on our website um you can
42:04
always reach out anybody can email us at DCFS info uh or you can call me directly
42:09
or email me so that's it I don't know how long I took great but it's a lot to
42:15
cover and this is just housing thank you let me open it up a
42:20
questions or I guess maybe a question or a
42:28
clarification I think for um Sabrina so I think when you were talking
42:34
about the um uh rental aers it sounded
42:39
like that was really only available to people that were homeless right now is
42:45
that accurate no no it's not it's it's actually for individuals who currently
42:50
are maybe housed and they have for whatever reason a rental AER situation
42:56
at their hand they will apply for uh rental lawyer in order to avoid eviction
43:01
okay so you do yeah I was maybe maybe it was in reference to temporary assistance or something else um and so a question
43:08
about the eligibility for that it I think the slide said that you could get 6 months for 5 years what if I needed
43:14
one month this year and two months 3 years from now but I it's it just adds up okay so it's it's not a onetime thing
43:21
up to 6 months it's I have a little bit of discretion there has been situation where somebody needed a a little more
43:27
than 6 months and so I have a bit of discretion I'm very careful about that because obviously we don't have a
43:34
bank that is not unplan but if somebody is really you know able to move forward
43:42
and they have enough income they just need seven months instead of six or maybe they need um they've expended
43:49
their five year um but maybe they need two months or whatever I will definitely
43:55
work I've also worked with other a you know again I could call sometimes I will
44:00
say Okay Catholic charity can you can you step in maybe you can pay one month and I'll pay the other we we do all
44:06
kinds of supporting each other in a network to try to assist individual because I do have a little bit of
44:12
discretion um but it's it's a judgment call and
44:18
sometime it's hard I wish I had a crystal ball I know yeah I think the the kind of eviction prevention aspect is is
44:25
really interesting it's seems like that little bit of assistance does really help people turn things around and so I
44:32
guess if anybody is listening and um finds themselves even feeling a couple of weeks behind it would probably be
44:38
best to reach out immediately to to the office for help and my recommendation would be to you know call the 211 number
44:45
or if not just email us at DCFS info and sort of give us a little bit of background so that we can assess and
44:51
figure out what the best option would be for you but absolutely the eviction prevention is key and I I think you know
44:58
the the recent report from the controller showing that Dutchess has less of an increase than other counties
45:05
honestly the only thing I could think about like why is that is is the
45:10
eviction prevention and the rental supplements um because that does make a difference yeah I think what we hear
45:17
here is that it you know people get into a little bit of a sticky situation and
45:22
then before you know it it's snowballs and it's like I don't have any options I can't afford anything and you know your
45:28
credits impacted and potentially and things like that so um so yeah it sounds like 211 or call your office and the
45:36
phone number was on the last slide right and the other thing I would tell people is to also keep in mind that you know it
45:43
it's not an easy process um you know and and sometime people don't want to deal
45:49
with us because it is a little intrusive the the application process the
45:55
requirements documentation that we ask and so they they kind of wait for the last minute and then it becomes like you
46:02
said a bigger crisis thank you and we'll post both presentations on the agenda so if
46:09
anybody missed anything who's listening you can go back and look at our agenda U relative to the eviction
46:16
prevention uh do you offer any does your office offer any advice or na a way to navigate like a good cause eviction no
46:23
but we do work with legal services of the Hudson Valley and uh we make the referral to them and they are able to
46:30
assist they do have a grant from the state to to assist people with you know evictions and and they will call
46:36
sometime they'll call me and they'll say hey Sabrina I have this case this is what your worker said here's where we
46:42
are and we try to help each other so that the client again can avoid eviction
46:47
they're pretty good mhm it's it's a service that's available to Duchess County resident great and and you both
46:54
said that you have Offices here in bacon I assume that's at the County building is that correct yes our office is at the
46:59
county building we're on the second floor and uh we have a team um that
47:05
really their work is snap that's what they work on the most but you could drop off any application for any other
47:11
program MH and you could just come in there and ask for assistance and speak to someone great thank you and if you
47:18
don't want to go to pipy and you want to have a conversation you just let us know and we have a little interview on The
47:24
Beacon side as well yeah related to that I'm wondering for
47:30
both of you you can talk about how you decide where in Duchess to physically
47:35
locate your services and how much you're kind of assessing that on an annual or other
47:41
Cadence that's a big one so
47:47
um we like in my department we serve 1.5
47:52
of every 10 people in duess County so when we do an assessment of
47:58
services the geographic distribution of those is very complex because it's everywhere
48:06
literally I do try to see where U the needs are and so when when we were in
48:12
pipy what I what I noticed so I came in on board on 2015 and what I noticed was
48:18
that everything was concentrated in pipsy and then there was a small office in milbrook not utiliz too too much but
48:27
pipy was busy we had 400 people in our lobby every day
48:32
average um and that was unsustainable so looking at the sort of like Geographic
48:40
and usage um Beacon made the most sense and because there was a site right there
48:46
DMV is already there it just made sense that that would be a perfect location for the southern part of Duchess County
48:54
uh at first we started it as a mixed um unit not just for SNAP but kind of mixed
49:00
um but then as we looked at our case load snap made the most sense and so now it's really your intake for SNAP but it
49:07
really covers all of does County anybody who has an intake um because it's all online and remote so we don't have to
49:15
have the physical presence so that diversion of individuals who live in the
49:21
south uh area of duess county has made a significant impact and I can tell you right now now in addition to you know as
49:28
I mentioned doc submit and all these other online tools that we offer
49:33
including for example child support if somebody wanted to pay child support they had to come to us to pay child support now you can pay online use your
49:40
credit card or whatever so all of these have made a difference and now my average daily in the pipy office is
49:47
about 120 compared to 400 um so it's a constant sort of
49:53
assessment the other thing that we do is if and I think Jim mentioned it when we have an emergency um you know we we will
50:00
dispatch we work with the Red Cross and all others you know and if there's like a major fire or things of that nature
50:06
we'll dispatch our staff on site so people don't have to come in so and I don't know if you want to add to
50:14
that I'll just add that we we also uh through ongoing needs assessment um so
50:21
one of the things that my department is responsible for is submitting to the state um A A A needs assessment and a
50:29
service plan basically for the community and you sort of have to identify what the needs are and then how you're going
50:36
to address those needs and with with what resources and so we always look at population and location um for for the
50:44
public mental health clinics which is really sort of the core of the public mental health system um we try to
50:51
disperse them in a way that is uh hopefully as accessible as it can be so
50:56
we have uh a site in pipy we have a site in Beacon we have a site in milbrook we
51:02
have a site in Dover and we have S in Rybeck so we try to you know we tried to put there tries
51:09
to be a location in it's not a it's not perfect it's you know no matter where
51:14
you live there's going to be one place that's but if the pandemic did did give us one gift it was tahal and that has
51:22
made Services much more accessible for folks um and reduced a lot of barriers
51:27
that were historically made it very difficult for people to get public Mental Health Service for example Child
51:34
Care Transportation um things that made it really hard for people to get to an
51:39
appointment um T Health has uh really helped address that issue so you know we
51:44
are grateful for that one piece of the um transition and services that came as a result of the
51:50
pandemic but it is an ongoing uh need and we but we do have Services you know
51:55
throughout the the county great thank you yeah I had the opportunity uh with
52:01
the county executive Sue Sereno to um just tour the second floor at the what we all call the DMV building because
52:09
that's the part we know and um it's much more used than it has been in the past
52:14
and I think that's because you've brought Services down to Beacon and you're running it out of the second floor and I just said was you know
52:21
visibly active and we're very appreciative so
52:27
um je Jee Marie while you're standing up I did have one question for you um so
52:32
you had mentioned the mental health first aid program can you just give a little bit of a like couple minute
52:38
summary of what that is I'm I'm somewhat interested in seeing if there's something we could do locally yes so
52:44
there's um Mental Health First Aid youth mental health first aid and team Mental Health First Aid there're three different versions um this is through
52:50
the National Council of Behavioral Health and it's uh it's a several hour training there's different VAR ation of
52:56
it there's some that you can do part online some are you know all in person you can do a hybrid of those things um
53:03
but it's a fairly long six to eight hour training it's an overview of mental
53:09
health conditions and then how do you support somebody who might be experiencing a mental health crisis how
53:16
do you you know what do you say what do you do and how do you connect that person to the support that they might
53:21
need um so it's it's excellent we we do this training in schools all of the time
53:27
um the youth Mental Health First Aid is for adults who work with young people uh
53:32
the regular Mental Health First Aid is really just for anybody um we we do them in churches we do them in community
53:39
centers um really anywhere um and then the Teen Mental Health proceed is their
53:45
newest version and that one is is for teenagers and that's you kind of
53:50
teaching teens how to support other teens are the upcoming trainings listed on your website so we could see if
53:56
there's one coming up right now um what we do is we we don't have a our trainer
54:05
has moved on to another job okay so that doesn't mean we can't do it though we
54:10
just do it differently so um right now the way it is is if someone's interested in hosting one of those trainings at
54:16
their site they can give us a call or send us an email and we can we can either do it ourselves at their location
54:24
or we can make sure that they get connected with another trainer okay thank you yeah sure we did have um I
54:31
know the our volunteer Ambulance Company hosted a mental health first aid
54:36
training um like about a month ago two months ago um and I know some other community groups have done it and I've
54:43
understand it's it's really impactful yeah it's it's a good training I used to do a lot of it I used to do
54:50
probably four of those trainings a month several jobs ago um it's an excellent training it's it's a really really good
54:57
for anybody who is interested in just learning about the basics of mental health and how to intervene when someone
55:03
needs support um I had a related question to
55:09
our sort of geography topic um I'm curious especially as um some of these
55:16
procedures um are going online which I agree is a really huge
55:21
accessibility um positive uh if you have partnered with um libraries or other
55:29
institutions that you know sometimes have some of those that that is some folks online access um and making sure
55:37
that you know Librarians who already do too much um might be able to help yeah
55:43
actually um thank you for that question we are actually in active conversation with the libraries uh Amy oh my gosh I'm
55:51
forgetting her last name she's the librarian in Red Hook I think she serves
55:58
on our youth board and uh she and I have been talking about ways that we can um
56:03
interact with libraries one of the thing that I'm planning on doing is a
56:09
presentation uh to the libraries as to our services but more like the application processes the
56:16
wwy benefit. goov whatever that they can have quickly available on site but the
56:21
other thing that we are talking about there is um unfortunately s cber security is
56:27
slowing me down even though I don't speak the cyber security language I do speak the attorney
56:33
language um but we are I'm looking for a
56:38
kios kind of approach so in the in the pipy office we have two kios that that the state shut down for cyber security
56:45
but I'm trying to get back online and the idea of the kios is you can put them anywhere in the community and somebody
56:50
if they if they have their card their EBT card or their their temporary assistant card they can slide the card
56:56
it recognizes them they can check their budget they can check where things are they can they can submit a document they
57:02
can scan the document to the machine will scan it give it back to them and print a receipt and it automatically
57:09
emails it to us and puts it into the system and then our staff received an email document dropped it's fantastic we
57:16
used it before covid and it was like wow it was great and then one bad thing
57:22
about Co was cyber security and then the state was like wow you know you you
57:27
can't do that we are in connection with the state again um they are more willing
57:32
we are going about a lot of legal Le obviously between the legal team and the IT team we're close very close and if we
57:40
can get this done my goal is to try to be able to put one of those kios in
57:46
various libraries because then that would really facilitate because not everybody has access to a computer and
57:53
that would really facilitate if people can come in do the application but then once they are
57:59
approved they can do a lot of the transactions at the library if we have a kios at the library so yes it is
58:05
something we're working on and hope to be able to accomplish wish me luck great good luck
58:12
absolutely St my my end of things with libraries we do a lot with libraries too we've actually done a lot of Mental
58:17
Health First aate trainings for libraries libraries are I'm sure you're aware a place where a lot of people end
58:22
up during the day if they have nowhere else to go um and we do a lot of Naran
58:27
training and we have also distributed uh they're they're called the locks boxes
58:32
and they have Naran in them we have um a whole bunch of different kinds we have
58:38
you know temperature controlled ones we have big ones we have little ones we have all different kinds of Naran lock
58:44
boxes and so we have um put them in all of the libraries across the count in and
58:49
and if you would like one in any municipal building in Beacon please let me know because we do have we do have uh
58:56
a stock pile so if there's places where you know you feel that there might be risk of Overdose we we have that as a
59:03
resource we should definitely have those if we don't already okay yeah do we have
59:08
one in here this seems like a good place for one not that I know okay I have one
59:14
in my office and I was actually trained to use it by the southern Duchess Coalition okay
59:22
fantastic I have a question on the H on housing it sounds like your program in a
59:28
in a way it's more reactive to people's needs is there a department or part of
59:35
your department for housing that are looking at how to help you know in
59:41
Beacon we're always it's just so unaffordable and they make money you know but they don't make enough money
59:47
where it might be like 40 50% of their income do you know of any anything at
59:52
the county level that helps that or even gets the word out about the good cause eviction and let you know the tenants
1:00:00
rights other than the the legal services so that would be the planning department
1:00:05
um so we are a member of the COC I think I mentioned the COC a little bit and um
1:00:10
so there's a lot of work around the planning department regarding sort of like affordable housing uh duess County
1:00:18
um has been working and has put money forward for like a l bank and you know
1:00:23
just really pushing and talking about zoning you know that's that's a big
1:00:28
issue in terms of trying to build and and increase the affordable housing um
1:00:34
in in our area and that's really under the leadership of our planning department um I mean I could talk a
1:00:41
little bit about it but I certainly am no expert okay thank you but but that um
1:00:47
2 on one uh and then option seven will get you to someone who could talk you
1:00:54
through what are your issues with respect to housing and potential eviction and then if if need be they can
1:01:00
refer you to someone to help you understand uh eviction procedures and
1:01:05
how the laws work correct um and and 211 I mean I specifically mentioned the D
1:01:11
you know hit seven for housing directly but you can call 211 for everything or contract with them covers everything
1:01:17
from Child Care to camps and you know any question you have any any any
1:01:22
assistance you need um they'll screen you and they'll make a referral to us as as needed and answer most of the
1:01:29
question and at least give you give you a listing of different places where you can go which is pretty
1:01:35
good um also sort of in that um policy Direction I was appreciate um you
1:01:43
mentioned the you were able to advocate for a supplement to the monthly allowance for temporary assistance um
1:01:50
and you mentioned there are quite a few regulations um that you're navigating
1:01:56
um and that you're helping people to navigate um are there any um just to try
1:02:04
and scope it to the county level um that are would be particularly meaningful in
1:02:10
terms of moving the needle on um where you see most common
1:02:17
barriers so there are really multiple barriers one so so one is definitely
1:02:23
affordability right I mean it's just that's that's basic if if you could be
1:02:28
in perfect shape everything is going really nice for you you got a great job but you just can't afford it right so
1:02:35
that that's and that's the need for affordable housing to be built throughout the county uh it's good it's
1:02:40
good business um but you know there are issues there the second thing um I think
1:02:46
that I that I see a lot of is you will have an individual who perhaps um for
1:02:53
one reason or another had you know maybe they lost their job and so they were with no income for a certain period of
1:02:59
time maybe they had a car accident and they sort of had no no income coming in
1:03:05
so they fell behind in their rent but then they get the job back and they can afford paying the rent moving forward
1:03:12
that's where the rental area comes into play um usually we're able to help those individuals but again the biggest
1:03:18
challenge for us is if the person makes a little more than the 200% poverty level mhm that's that that's sort of
1:03:27
like the biggest challenge right so if you if you make a little more so you
1:03:34
you're above that 200% you're still in that Cliff right you still can't make it
1:03:41
but you're not eligible for us we it's what we call I like that term excess income that's how you know like in know
1:03:48
drop- down menu it will say denied for excess income and every time I see it I'm like
1:03:53
seriously but that's that's probably the the biggest challenge in terms of
1:03:59
helping individuals that we see could use this extra little help yeah and we
1:04:05
fall short of being able to help them because they don't they're not eligible under the federal guidance and that's
1:04:12
the 200% of the federal poverty level um
1:04:17
and that restriction is sort of infor when you say that um that's the
1:04:22
Restriction that's stopping you from helping people with program are fedal programs right Federal program so the
1:04:28
state has been trying to step in and like I say for example the safe program which is the most recent program that
1:04:33
they launch it says okay you don't need to meet the TA eligibility criteria that's really targeting that group that
1:04:39
we were talking about that just makes a little bit more yeah um so so that's helpful but again it's limited it's it's
1:04:45
sort of a one shot Grant to the county and once you spend it that's it right so
1:04:51
then you wait for the next budget fiscal year to hope that there's enough um so they are trying um but when you when you
1:04:58
run a DSS program you are really pretty much running a federal program and and
1:05:04
so the rules are pretty strict there right so your um sort of
1:05:09
supplement strategy the supplement strategy is a state supplement you know and and my so so my argument to see to
1:05:17
put it mindly was basically okay so listen um we have more safety nets than
1:05:22
we have TANF right so you're already paying we're paying 71% you're paying
1:05:29
29% but just you're already paying if I have to pay a hotel this is how much I'm
1:05:35
spending if I have to open an apartment and have them in an apartment and play a
1:05:40
supplement here's how much we're paying and this is equal x do a month of saving for you and for me right so that's how
1:05:48
we were able to get the supplement uh so most counties um that could demonstrate
1:05:54
that um and wanted to apply did apply it is more work for us don't it's more
1:06:00
people work but it's worth it um because in the long one you're saving money and
1:06:05
you're providing someone with an actual housing as opposed to emergency shelter
1:06:12
yeah right so that makes a lot of sense and just to say the obvious part out loud um in terms of a federal poverty
1:06:19
level the cost of living in our region is higher than maybe the country
1:06:26
average um and that might be part of why there are some of the discrepancies that
1:06:31
Pam was talking about yeah I mean the feds will set up a rate that's sort of like kind of Nationwide they have a
1:06:38
little bit of regionalization but very little yeah you can't compare I don't know Monroe County to duess County to
1:06:45
Sullivan County right we it's but it's uh it's not designed for that
1:06:51
differentiation so the flat amount I mean like I I look at the that
1:06:57
chart and if I look for it for um say maybe Green County or Albany County it
1:07:02
might have $2 more you know well big deal it's still not enough so it it it's
1:07:12
it's part of the difficulty I think for all Social Services is if you don't try to be creative your your assistance only
1:07:20
goes so far and it it it's not helping the people get out of poverty just kind
1:07:26
of keeping them there and the goal is to try to be more um strategic in using your resources in
1:07:35
and and partnering in order to really get them out of poverty right because
1:07:40
that ultimately that is our goal right so finding a job applying for SSI we have a lot of people that come to us and
1:07:46
they are unemployable um but they have not been um able to get SSI I mean if
1:07:52
anybody knows you apply for SSI you probably get denied you know 90% of the time um so we have a contract with legal
1:07:59
services of the Hudson Valley and they have a dedicated paralal in our office to assist anyone so if we see someone
1:08:05
that comes in we're like oh you know what you really should be on SSI so here
1:08:10
this person is going to help you apply and if you fail they will also help you
1:08:15
you know reapply reapply right and and fight it and appeal it um while we are
1:08:21
assisting you but ultimately we know that if we don't help you get into to that category of assistance you're going
1:08:28
to be on temporary assistance for the rest of your life yeah that's that Continuum you want the to continum and
1:08:34
we've been successful and we've been able to demonstrate that the individual every time we have somebody move into
1:08:40
the SSI how much money we are saving is just it's worth the investment
1:08:46
and it's a small investment it's just one paralal yeah so goes a long way well
1:08:51
thanks to that paralal um anything else before we wrap up so just thank you this I think was
1:08:59
helpful and I hope that our community finds it helpful um so really appreciate the the overview anytime and we we do go
1:09:07
out and offer workshops you know I tell people all the time if you have agencies in your community there are case
1:09:12
managers who want to know how to navigate our crazy world we do offer workshops I call it navigated the world
1:09:19
of DSs so yeah I think that gets at one of my questions which we do have a quite
1:09:25
a few social workers and other folks um who are coming at this from a place of
1:09:31
wanting to offer support um is should they also just reach out to you directly
1:09:37
I mean I know that it it's not that they're they're looking to volunteer so it's probably being connected to um one
1:09:43
of your partner organizations so they can yeah they can just email us and sort of explain where they are and if they
1:09:48
want to be added to my mailing list when we do the navigating the system Workshop I usually do at least twice a year uh we
1:09:54
just did one on temporary assistance application process um last fall we did
1:10:00
one on housing so if they want to be added to the mailing list they can um
1:10:06
certainly email me and ask to be added to the list so that they can Avail themsel of this training um and then at
1:10:12
that location too I mean the last training we had 82 people representing about 40 organization so they can make
1:10:18
connection with those organization and if they want to volunteer and assist um I'm sure people will be more than happy
1:10:26
that's great just add quickly um duess County also has a Medical Reserve Corp
1:10:31
which is a prev vetted um group of volunteers that are um from many
1:10:37
different walks of life but often are uh nurses doctors social workers all sorts
1:10:42
of folks from uh with all different kinds of experiences and we have a lot of MRC members uh on our trauma team um
1:10:50
we have a new disaster mental health initiative that we're working on and we will be using unteers for that so um
1:10:57
there is a process that you have to go through and you have to go through some training and things like that but um
1:11:02
certainly we're always looking for more um volunteers through the Medical Reserve Corp as well that's
1:11:09
great okay um so thank you both for coming I'm very appreciative that you were willing to do that um one of our
1:11:16
follow-ups is to reach out and ask what are the best ways for us to provide links from our City website onto the
1:11:22
right places for you and we'll we'll do that as the next step as well all right
1:11:28
and again thank you so much for both of you you know Gan Marie and Sabrina for coming thank you all right thanks
1:11:37
yep okay um so next item uh is an update
1:11:43
on 248 tyronda uh and I think this is the
1:11:48
applicants or are you going to help that or they they're going to start up next no I think it's the applicant the applicant is is here tonight from 248 Ty
1:11:56
because the city council resolution in December authorizing the waiver of
1:12:01
certain requirement of a zoning code and authorizing the issuance of a certificate occupancy set forth a number
1:12:06
of conditions which the applicant had to comply with the applicant has complied with those conditions and except for one
1:12:13
which required that they appear before the council to give an update and provide a status of a BMR unit so we've asked them to come tonight to sort of
1:12:20
give you an overview of what steps they've taken to comply with the conditions the current status of the rental of the BMR unit
1:12:25
as well as just also briefly touch upon the rental of the commercial unit although not part of a resolution is
1:12:30
also something that is of interest to the council and so Jay blumfeld from the the applicant is here tonight to give
1:12:36
you that update thank you Nick good evening um also came with Angelina who RS our
1:12:42
management team in case there's any questions I can't answer and I just wanted to start by saying again thank
1:12:48
you for working with us to get the building open back in December and we know it wasn't an easy decision we
1:12:54
appreciate apprciate it um following that resolution we worked to get all the
1:13:00
checklist items to get to the co uh done worked with Bruce uh for the following
1:13:05
month or so we got the TCO on January 24th and on January 25th or 26th we
1:13:13
started uh we started marketing the units um we marketed as required the BMR
1:13:20
units in the same um line as all the marker great units and we're very happy
1:13:28
to report that we have actually filled all abmr units as of this past weekend
1:13:33
and that's in addition to I believe as D said all the other checklist items that
1:13:38
were required of us I think following this we owe the council a written update
1:13:43
the end of March and a and as required as requested by the uh City a imperson
1:13:49
update I think that was in May um the the 8 BMR units that we filled also so
1:13:56
um just have a few stats all of them came from tenants within Duchess County
1:14:02
seven out of the a BMR units actually came from within the city of Beacon um
1:14:07
they're all going to be moved in sometime over this month I think some are moving in um this Friday and I
1:14:16
believe that the uh remaining BMR units are moving in by April 1st so that's
1:14:22
where we are on the BMR units I would also mentioned that eight out of the 10 initial leases signed were those 8 BMR
1:14:29
units um in addition to that with the commercial I spoke with Brian MSI actually today who's still um at the he
1:14:38
still has all the listings up and um he's feeling any inquiries regarding the commercial building I had uh given a
1:14:45
written update to the council the end of January which mentioned a potential uh
1:14:51
medical use for the building uh that broker seems
1:14:57
to it seems that there were some miscommunications with that it's not off
1:15:03
the table but it seems less likely at this point um there haven't really been
1:15:08
any significant updates since that written update uh January February sometimes a little slower but we did not
1:15:14
really see anything significant since that written update and well anything
1:15:20
that happens between now and then will be detailed in the letter that we owe at the end of March so that's really the
1:15:27
complete update that I have you could take any questions
1:15:35
okay Council good no questions yeah I think it's Bally just coming giving us the update
1:15:42
right yep all right okay all righty thank you thank
1:15:47
you so much thank you oh it's good news to hear um do Natalie are you on
1:15:57
online can I ask um sorry before Natalie starts just to finish up with this I have under the impression maybe I was
1:16:03
misled that we would hear from Hudson River housing as well am I
1:16:09
misremembering what we talked about or is that changed it changed if very
1:16:14
request they request to do scheduling issues on their end um to be moved to a different Council agenda and we felt
1:16:20
that as 248 was ready we would bring 248 and then work with um HR R when it uh
1:16:26
was better for their schedule okay so they will come to us at some point and we thought we could also um add into
1:16:33
that discussion of the plus one so they're ProMag gating the the program
1:16:39
and and then can launch it here okay awesome so maybe by this summer but no
1:16:44
firm dates yet we were thinking a couple months at most thank you I appreciate that yeah I imagine they have their
1:16:51
hands full this month yeah that's what I was thinking as well
1:16:56
yes so next item is uh adus uh and I'm wondering if our planers
1:17:04
online and I can everyone hear me there you go yeah hi n hey good evening hi um
1:17:12
so I can walk through kind of packet of materials real quick um first thing you have is an updated memo uh this memo is
1:17:19
kind of the decision tree of questions that we went through together um at the last Workshop and so it's been updated
1:17:26
there to kind of reflect um the conclusions that the council came to at that last meeting so what that outlines
1:17:33
in terms of changes that were made to the local law is we did make changes to permit um accessory apartments on all
1:17:42
single on all lots that have a single family home um in all districts uh we
1:17:47
did also add the definition based on conversation we retained owner um the owner occupancy requirement and either
1:17:54
the primary or the accessory unit but we did notice that the definition for owner
1:18:00
uh was not in the kind of more General section of the code it was just in the section on short-term rentals um so to
1:18:08
kind of tighten that up we did add a definition for owner um and owner primary residents into the
1:18:15
code we remove the minimum and maximum square footage requirement for the
1:18:20
accessory dwelling units and instead we now allow the size of accessory Apartments to be regulated on the
1:18:27
minimum size side to be regulated by New York State Building Code and on the maximum size they are still required to
1:18:34
be less than 50% um of the primary unit um there is
1:18:39
an option uh if your Adu happens to be larger than um 50% that you do have the
1:18:45
a a release valve I guess in some ways uh to go before the planning board we also uh remove the parking
1:18:53
requirement for accessory dwelling units and then finally we moved a few items um into the purview of the
1:19:01
building inspector for approval so now the building inspector um previously had
1:19:06
the ability to review applications for accessory Apartments um within existing
1:19:12
primary structures as long as there was no modification uh so we retain that uh
1:19:17
we also allow them to have a review over um accessory apartments in existing um
1:19:22
existing accessory structures with some modification both to either the primary or the accessory building so the only
1:19:28
thing that still is kind of in the court of the planning board is uh new adus or
1:19:35
new accessory apartments that are detached from the primary structure so those are the changes that
1:19:41
we kind of went through in the memo and then you can see them reflected in the draft local law it does touch upon a few
1:19:47
different sections of the code so um you'll kind of see that track chain version in there where there's changes
1:19:54
to accessory apartments that section uh
1:20:25
diagrams of the setbacks you know both setbacks for the primary structures typical lot sizes and then the setbacks
1:20:32
for accessory Apartments so the one thing that I you know the summary of that document that I would give to you
1:20:38
is there's two districts that really jumped out to me where the setbacks um
1:20:43
for accessory units may not make sense um one of those is the
1:20:50
r110 uh family District while you can while there still is space on a on a lot right in the r110
1:20:59
let me just flip to that
1:21:06
slide uh while you can still fit an accessory what you're seeing there right is a the typical size the typical shape
1:21:12
of lots within this District 100t by 85 ft width um typical size of a primary
1:21:18
unit and then kind of what the setbacks require so you can see you can still you can still fit an accessory unit of a of
1:21:24
a pretty substantial size on that lot but you do start to get them quite close
1:21:30
um to the primary structure and it's just limited space and it kind of ends up being right in the middle of the backyard of that structure so one
1:21:37
recommendation that I wanted to put in front of the council to consider is we
1:21:42
could bring those setbacks down to five and five which would match other similar
1:21:48
districts like the r1-- 5 District both of those districts
1:21:54
have 5ft rear yard 5 foot side yard um and those lots are pretty
1:22:00
similar to what we see in the r110 district so I thought that was one consideration and then the other one
1:22:07
which I think may just be an error um in the code is the rd5 district um if you
1:22:14
flip to that slide uh the 30 foot setbacks for sidey yard and rear yard
1:22:19
essentially you you can you cannot do um an Adu there's no area on a lot that you could do a on the smallest size lot
1:22:27
right the minimum lot size uh obviously we can't analyze every single rd5 lot
1:22:32
but on the standard lot size um it would not be feasible to do an Adu so that
1:22:39
one also recommending that the rear yard could come down to 15 and the side yard
1:22:45
could come down to 10 which is actually the sidey yard setback for the primary structure so for some reason the
1:22:50
accessory structure has a greater has a greater side set back in that District
1:22:56
than the primary structure does so those were really I you know I
1:23:01
don't think looking at this I don't necessarily think that um yard setbacks are
1:23:07
prohibiting uh too many accessory Apartments besides those two districts
1:23:12
where I think there's just some um either errors in the in the chart in the table or just kind of a
1:23:20
lack of practic practicable space to put an Adu
1:23:26
so a couple of things back on the memo just want to clarify uh the item eight
1:23:32
question um I think the answer that I I just want to make sure I understand that I'm reading the answer right which is
1:23:39
what we're saying is if the Adu is going in an existing structure whether it's
1:23:45
the primary residence or an accessory building uh that would be discretion to
1:23:51
the city building inspector but if the except ACC dwelling unit is in a new
1:23:56
structure that would require a site plan yes correct okay I just want to
1:24:01
make sure I understood that if you were to enlarge a existing structure would that trigger a site plan as well so I
1:24:09
think we're saying no is that right Natalie that if it's an existing structure if if you're within the
1:24:15
setbacks I think we said as long as you're kind of within the parameters let me just check P that language up um
1:24:26
so this is Section I in the in the accessory department so it says the building inspector shall have approval
1:24:31
Authority for accessory apartments that are contained entirely within an existing single family dwelling are
1:24:39
contained entirely within an existing accessory building or require an expansion to the existing primary
1:24:45
accessory building provided that all setback requirements and Provisions of this section are met so as long as
1:24:51
you're kind of not going outside any of the numerical par ERS that are otherwise outlined in this section of the code you
1:24:58
could do an expansion right as long as you're not encroaching into your sidey setbacks or your total kind of
1:25:05
percentage of footprint size right and that was consistent what it what it leaves is if you're kind of
1:25:11
expanding Beyond any of the parameters um or you're building a new accessory
1:25:16
apartment that is detached right and that was consistent with if you're a homeowner and you want
1:25:23
to expand your home you can do that again as long as you're not um exceeding the setbacks right so this would say you
1:25:30
could do the same with the accessory unit as long as you're not um disturbing the
1:25:36
setbacks yeah I might want to revisit this in the future and I appreciate that
1:25:43
you're adding another structure onto a like we don't currently require single home builders to go before the planning
1:25:49
board my understanding is that can go through the building department I I get how if you're adding a another building
1:25:55
which could be up to half the size that as a community we might want to have that go before the planning board at
1:26:01
least as an initial thing I feel particularly if we are going to move to a world that we might get to sometime in
1:26:09
the future where we're having pre-approved site plans those will probably be most coste effective if
1:26:14
they're new buildings um which therefore means we're saying we're doing that because we want
1:26:20
to save money but also saying you have to go before the planning board so we're kind of saying opposite things in terms of what we're trying to incentivize so
1:26:27
I'm not feeling strongly enough at the moment of reopening the idea of do we want to allow it just for all new
1:26:33
structures as long as they're still within the setback requirements and meet what we would what we already set out in
1:26:40
here but that is something that I'm thinking about so U the analogy would be I'm a
1:26:46
homeowner I'm I'm not doing an accessory unit but I'm doing an additional structure and does that require fire
1:26:54
sight plan and if we say we don't then okay if that additional structure
1:26:59
happens to be a dwelling unit that also as long as it's meeting the setbacks you would say wouldn't that be okay without
1:27:06
site plan yes that's what I'm thinking where my brain is going I I think that's logical and it it follows the the home
1:27:13
expansion analogy we just did that's where I'm also leaning Molly so I mean
1:27:20
again I I think that we've had so few applications in the past I don't know
1:27:26
three or four years there were like four in that memo so it is hard to judge and
1:27:31
I I think it would be interesting you know depending on the outcome here this is one that might be good to to come
1:27:38
back after a couple of applications of gone through the process or we see what people are really interested in doing
1:27:44
and um either we've we're on the right track here or we're not um but I I'm I'm
1:27:50
of a similar mind I'd rather kind of let let the Plus applications flow through
1:27:56
see what we're getting um and and I I I do feel that if you're within the
1:28:01
setbacks and you're kind of like you know generally following the guidance
1:28:07
that seems okay to go before the planning board or the building department versus planning board to me yeah and to your point about coming back
1:28:12
I think we talked about this a couple years ago last time so we're already kind of in that Cadence exactly trying
1:28:18
to encourage this at that you don't have to be a big developer but if you're a homeowner you can still add to the housing Supply supp if that works for
1:28:25
you and your family yeah so that's suggesting a change to what the current
1:28:30
language is Right which would say even if it's a new accessory building for an
1:28:37
accessory unit as long as it's meeting the setback requirements that also would not require planning board are we okay
1:28:44
making that change okay yeah I think it's all right I think it's logical and again we get to
1:28:50
revisit um but I think we've had the opposite problem right we had access dwelling units we didn't call them that
1:28:56
for 30 years and I think we had 20 in those 30 years or some number of It's a
1:29:01
small number and then as Amber's saying since we changed the law again only a handful so um so that's that's okay yeah
1:29:09
I I just have a it's sort of related to this but what if um you had a garage
1:29:14
detached garage and you wanted to build on top of that garage and you want to keep the
1:29:20
garage as a function of garage would that be allowed in this
1:29:25
situation so I I think so right because y an existing accessory building so say
1:29:32
it's a 1000t garage y you could theoretically put a th000 foot um Adu on
1:29:39
top of that with with building inspector approval yeah yeah I think that's what
1:29:45
we're saying yeah I think it would depend I mean right you'd have to look at the height restrictions within that
1:29:50
zoning district and you and based on the code right now you'd also have to look at the size of the at the size of the
1:29:55
primary structure so I think we're I think you would still get um potentially
1:30:01
depending on the size of say just with your example you have a 1000t garage you want to put 1,000 sqt unit on there as
1:30:08
long as the primary structur is 2,000 ft or larger um then I think you could do
1:30:14
that within the code if you're if that was slightly more than 50% of the primary structure that that would send
1:30:21
you to planning board yep again I I think last week and I might be misremembering this but I thought we
1:30:28
decided that the smaller houses are penalized in in such a way that they can
1:30:33
only build relative to the size of their place as opposed to so a bigger house
1:30:40
could have a bigger and I thought we we we eliminated that that percentage we
1:30:47
did I mean I did hear that discussion at the last one but I think we I I heard some back and forth there and I think
1:30:54
the direction I went with this based on the comments was we did remove the
1:30:59
minimum and the maximum but I you know in terms of square footage uh but that
1:31:04
50% was retained because I think it's kind of in the nature of
1:31:10
the maybe the 50% could go up but having that limitation is somewhat within the nature of it being accessory right I
1:31:17
think if we start going too large and allowing accessory units to become equal
1:31:22
in size or or bigger to um to the single family to the primary structure then
1:31:29
then we start getting into the area where we're talking about two families you're just allowing two family on one
1:31:34
property right so I think we start to get I was a little bit hesitant to remove that 50% that um ratio I guess
1:31:43
requirement because then I I didn't know where to necessarily draw the line between two family resident
1:31:51
structures so which which we're trying to achieve something that looks accessory and
1:31:58
doesn't conflict with the size and scale of the existing um I'm not sure is that really
1:32:06
our intent or is that our desire so I'm I'm okay going in the
1:32:11
direction you're suggesting which is why wouldn't we pull the 50% requirement as well so long as it had the set by
1:32:18
accident didn't exceed 1,000 square ft yeah um again I'm just taking example
1:32:24
say someone wanted to their house was too small and rather than go buy a new house
1:32:30
they built a bigger unit and then the main unit or the primary unit would then
1:32:35
become kind of the accessory unit yeah we certainly have homes in Beacon you
1:32:40
know built in the 20s and 30s that were you know are considered small by modern
1:32:46
standards and you might I could see that situation again I I don't see any from
1:32:51
my view I I'm with you where you're going which is I'm okay pulling the percentage again have to meet setback
1:32:59
requirements that's that's that's what I'm having okay but was it pull the percentage but add back in the thare
1:33:06
foot maximum yes no no why bother why do that
1:33:11
either what so there would be no minimum no maximum and no percentage
1:33:19
relative to the original structure M okay yeah um I'm not sure I'm okay with that not
1:33:27
I'm I I just think kind of what Natalie was hinting at that you're basically getting it you're subdividing some Lots
1:33:33
essentially you're basically subdividing into two homes and so I don't know if that could impact the character of
1:33:39
Beacon I get that Amber's point that we haven't had a lot of these so I'm like okay is it worth us doing this to have
1:33:45
that tradeoff but that's an area where I'm like ooh I'm not I'm not sure that's actually what we want and this is also
1:33:52
based on anecdotal information of people have quite within their rights built to their maximum size and some of the new
1:33:58
houses we have built and they are much larger um and so I think when I think about the tone of the city and people's
1:34:04
concerns about the size of buildings that I do want to be cognizant of that
1:34:09
so it with keeping that in mind I think for now the part that George is talking
1:34:14
about I'm okay with having said that if others on the council feel like it's
1:34:20
worth removing that as well allowing larger places Maybe like the example you gave Lee is actually the the current
1:34:27
home becomes kind of the accessory one by default um because it is smaller than what you could build on what happens to
1:34:33
be a larger rear yard um then I'm okay with trying that but my my personal
1:34:39
instinct is not to go that route right now yeah I'm of several Minds on this
1:34:44
and I I am curious Nick um if if there is a a definition somewhere that would
1:34:52
sort of make that flip that the larger unit becomes the primary unit or if there's a way for a homeowner
1:34:59
to designate or like decide which of the units on their property is the primary unit and which is the Adu um as a
1:35:08
technicality um and I'll also say broadly that I'm interested in the conversation about subdivisions and
1:35:15
about multif family zoning but I'm am not sure that doing it through the Adu
1:35:21
law it functionally is the way to do it m right so we could address your comment
1:35:29
about um requiring that the larger unit be the primary residence becomes a
1:35:34
question of enforcement mode which I think would be difficult and require the building insector to go in and inspect
1:35:40
and to ask who's living in which unit when when when we did the uh
1:35:45
original version of the accessory dwelling um back in the 9s we were
1:35:51
envisioning um a senior living by themselves and they might choose to live in the smaller unit and could better
1:35:58
support their house by living in the smaller one and rting out the large one because they were down to one person so
1:36:04
the Way It Was Written at the time was it was the owner's Choice which one but one needed to be smaller than the other
1:36:11
that was the way it was set up then not saying that's why we set it up now but I'm okay if the owner chooses to live in
1:36:18
the smaller unit oh for sure yeah yeah I do want to separate those things that
1:36:24
the owner can live in either as long as they're living on the property um you know in this phase at least of the law
1:36:31
um but that yeah I feel like we are getting into an odd definition of
1:36:36
accessory unit when one is larger than the other which one is the accessory unit
1:36:42
yeah and I I I hear your comment Molly it's it's almost like if if there isn't
1:36:48
a difference in size you've effectively had a two family right and is that what we're
1:36:54
doing and and I hear you um but I I right now I'm tending to lean on the
1:36:59
side of of open it up and see what we find um you know I don't think it's a
1:37:05
huge issue to say let's not open it up and see what we find but I again I lean on the open it up right
1:37:11
now I mean to clarify we're keeping the check though that someone who might want to do this scenario and put of a larger
1:37:18
unit it would still be a site plan review or are we taking away that requirement no so it unless it's
1:37:24
violating the setbacks that you know if if it's still in the envelope that you
1:37:29
could do a single family house or an expansion of the single family house then if it's within that envelope it
1:37:35
would would not require site plan it's just building inspector uh question five says that for accessory Apartments
1:37:41
greater than 50% of the primary building site plan approval from the planning board is required that that's the one
1:37:46
we're discussing to remove it to remove I would say keep the over if it's over
1:37:52
50% to get the site plan approval it could be done but they need to get site plan
1:37:59
approval that would be a good compromise that's what I lean towards as well but I
1:38:04
think that's how it's written is we left it last week and that we said to leave it and
1:38:10
that's evaluated but we'd have that check built in yeah we're getting rid of the sentence before okay everybody good
1:38:17
I think that's what we're doing all right yeah and I I think what what I'm hearing is we're all this is an item right on the edge
1:38:23
and I think it's good I'm good either way so this is fine I mean and I'm getting to that age where it's like I
1:38:29
would move into a smaller place and let somebody live in the bigger place and still be on the property sense yeah
1:38:38
yeah okay so just to clarify we're we're keeping it as it's we're keeping it as
1:38:43
it's written with the we're taking out the minimum but keeping the sorry taking
1:38:49
out the 50% maximum but if uh do design goes above 50% it requires then it
1:38:56
requires that plan approval yeah I like that I think that works okay all right
1:39:01
just one other thing U regarding the setbacks on in R1 uh 7.5 and R15 it's
1:39:08
the 5ft setbacks I thought we we talked a little bit about this last week that
1:39:13
you know there might be an existing structure that's 5 ft away um like a shed um and then it
1:39:21
suddenly becomes a residential it's it's rather close to the to the neighbor if they both and so
1:39:28
I don't know if there's room in those two zones to increase that to 10 ft well so I I think the issue of
1:39:36
setbacks again I I have a separate set of issues around it one is I I'm not sure they're all conformed yet but the
1:39:43
other one is suppose there's um a garage that's not it doesn't meet the set back
1:39:49
but it's an existing building um and you want to build in where the garage is the
1:39:55
garage has been there that's probably not as big an issue of having a garage near your if you're the adjoining
1:40:01
landowner but if all of a sudden it's windows and a person it might right and
1:40:06
so do how do we deal with an existing accessory building that's too
1:40:12
close whether it's doesn't meet the setback or your suggestion maybe the setbacks aren't enough if there's
1:40:18
Windows as opposed to a garage yeah right and sorry there is already existing provision for that in the code
1:40:25
that's existing right that that's um subsection H that says an existing
1:40:31
structure that that does not conform to yard requirements may be converted to an accessory apartment without a variance
1:40:37
from the zoning board of appeals if the proposed use will not enlarge or increase dimensional non-conformity so
1:40:43
that's that's existing language in the code so you can add windows but you could not add a second
1:40:49
floor is that or or yeah closer to the
1:40:54
property okay okay so now let's go back to
1:41:01
George's right so that deals with the non-conform the beyond the setback So within the set it's meeting the setback
1:41:08
but um are the setbacks okay yeah and does that does it prohibit it um if by
1:41:15
having increased setback in those two zones will it prohibit adus or should we
1:41:21
consider increasing the setback yeah the one thought I had was there may be circumstances where we want to give the
1:41:28
building inspector some some ability to refer to planning board if
1:41:34
something uh and maybe that could cover it well it's sort of as of right right
1:41:40
now that it's 5 ft um if we put something in there that I don't know
1:41:47
leaves a lot up for the building inspector to De to well so maybe a
1:41:52
criteria would be cuz we just have to play with this a little bit um is you know if the building inspector observes
1:41:59
that there are living quarters you know considered in his you
1:42:04
know that person's judgment too close or something like that because you know if it's if it's a 5- foot setback and you
1:42:12
can build it and there's no House nearby nobody cares right we're all good with that right it's it's if the accessory
1:42:18
structure is too close to the next house over or something too close is very subjective yeah I think you have to
1:42:24
Define it Nick you got away well say if it's a dwelling unit within X speed of
1:42:30
the accessory growing on another lot yeah to say within 10 ft or 15 ft or
1:42:36
twice a setback or the set to the property line yeah Define to the living
1:42:43
order of the next of any adjacent if you leave it subjective then we're such a I
1:42:50
do like twice the setback to the living cour
1:42:55
I feel like that seems pretty reasonable really just in in those two zones cuz it's such a small thing I
1:43:01
think if you go into other zones it doesn't really apply yeah I know and I'm trying to be like fair and be
1:43:06
like just cuz you live in this Zone that has smaller setbacks like should apply to everybody I guess yeah yeah I will
1:43:14
just say I mean we have we did actually have um an application before the planning board not too long ago that was
1:43:20
a garage an existing garage detached from the primage structure sitting right
1:43:25
on the property line um being converted to an apartment and I mean yeah there's
1:43:31
just so much Nuance to it right because the the way they designed it was that it was in the existing it was in the
1:43:37
existing garage structure it wasn't taking up the whole Space they set it so it was on the side away from the
1:43:43
property line and then there was a lot of landscaping and trees so I
1:43:49
I yeah I mean I hear that I definitely hear the concerns about them being but I feel like and I I understand that we're taking
1:43:55
away the planning Board review aspect of that um but there
1:44:01
are cases I think where it has worked out there's many garage structures are
1:44:07
going to be really close to your property line right just from typically how they how they get set up so I do worry about that prohibiting quite a few
1:44:15
of the conversion options yeah could we put something in there with maybe there's no windows on a second floor
1:44:21
that if it goes up to a second floor no windows on the on the lot line I don't
1:44:26
know I I guess like just to kind of check but I think the concern is
1:44:32
that if so and I'm just going to keep using the example that you were using where you're 5T the setback is 5T the
1:44:38
rear setback the side setbacks are 15 I think in that District No the side set backs are we're also five okay so so
1:44:45
you've got a five foot setback and I think that what we're concerned about is saying like Okay let's just make sure
1:44:51
that you know people have some space and I thought we were saying that in those
1:44:57
cases it might be good for them to be referred to the planning board for things like what Natalie was just talking about to help with screening to
1:45:04
inform the design to say like you know okay no windows because you're you know
1:45:10
peering into somebody else's space so I mean if that's the case I'm F I'm okay with kind of referring that maybe like
1:45:18
you know twice the setback to the next possible dwelling to the planning board and and letting them kind of help with
1:45:24
the neighborhood um you know peace and and Community
1:45:31
yeah we we could also maybe come up with something other than site plan so that
1:45:37
they're not preparing a full site plan of our property and maybe it's just for a special accessory unit setback permit
1:45:44
and we give the plan board criteria to establish and issue a permit just to sort of work with the applicant on
1:45:50
addressing those legitimate neighborhood concerns yeah I like I like that idea because the
1:45:55
example Natalie gave was so good like they they you know put in the screening they they consciously oriented the
1:46:01
building so that it wasn't right on top and yeah that probably doesn't need a full sight plan it's more of a like
1:46:08
Consulting but with with actual like decision-making Authority right so they
1:46:14
would just come with a survey of their property and Architects plan perhaps and then work with the planning board and maybe it's working with the planning
1:46:20
board in the rols the ARB yeah that it's certificate of appropriateness right
1:46:26
somewhere along that which we do for historic buildings yes that seems
1:46:31
reasonable yeah yeah you know the example the drawing that is on page 45
1:46:36
that's the one that's got five foot setbacks you know if if that's the typical neighborhood the houses are all
1:46:43
up where the main house is on this and the accessory unit is probably all by
1:46:49
itself and so it would work if if we had something that kind of I I like this
1:46:55
idea better than the at least X feet from that it'd be some simpler process
1:47:02
uh and some easier approval process right can we can we write that not
1:47:10
presently but yes not that up we just go to the
1:47:15
kitchen but yes now I can work on that we can have that in the draft law so your next step would be I think you're
1:47:20
there you'll tell me if you're not to schedule public care and refer us to the planning board yeah so we'll Natalie and
1:47:26
I will'll work on that we'll incorporate it if you're not please with you want to tweak it you have that opportunity but at least you're moving it along I would
1:47:32
be ready for that as a Next Step y I just want to clarify for my own understanding we're talking about this
1:47:39
in general um for uh otherwise setback compliant
1:47:45
buildings are we requiring this also for existing buildings that do not meet the
1:47:50
setback requirements because we're talking about the example that I thought you were talking about
1:47:56
George is like there's a garage that's on the property line and no not necessarily just close you have a garage
1:48:02
that is allowed by current setbacks that as f as 5 ft say it's 5T from the
1:48:08
property line okay that's allowed for an accessory building okay now you turned that into an accessory dwelling mhm
1:48:14
that's a much closer you now have a residential building much closer to potentially another residential building
1:48:19
that the neighbor hasn't gotten used to or wasn't prepared for to have a a living space so close to their property
1:48:27
line so this sort of setback permit or certificate of appropriateness would apply to both existing buildings that
1:48:33
are being converted whether or not they meet the site requirements or as the
1:48:41
setback requirements and new construction I thought it was just existing or propos that don't meet the
1:48:48
current setback requirement okay no well I was kind of Advocate I was just I was just saying
1:48:54
should we look at this it's 5T these two zones have 5ft setback for accessory
1:49:00
buildings if we were to make that 10 ft would it disallow in these situations
1:49:07
all right so maybe that's yeah so now I'm hearing where you are so this would
1:49:12
be in where in the zones where the setbacks are small right 5 ft R15 and
1:49:20
r175 there's not a lot of room in those we would say even if you want
1:49:26
to build within the setback there might be an additional step of saying it might
1:49:31
need an appropriateness review yeah yeah I think it's either that or what George is saying is is make
1:49:38
the setbacks bigger but that might prohibit anything yeah yeah it also
1:49:44
disin disincentivizes the homeowner because they're having to take away more of their backyard um in order to accommodate I
1:49:51
think I lean toward the like I think I lean towards what was proposed as opposed to changing the setbacks
1:49:59
again more from a like I I I I just feel it's I feel more
1:50:05
concerned about changing the setbacks than I do for those cases of asking people to like do a little bit of an
1:50:11
extra step with the Architectural Review Board you could keep the setback and just say a setback permit shall not be
1:50:16
required when you are twice the distance so if they want to voluntarily increase the set to 10 okay you could build the
1:50:23
code that way so you don't change your setback but you give someone incentive to double they can avoid a step yeah I
1:50:28
feel better about that than changing the setbacks yeah I agree and then then the lots that have larger setbacks they're
1:50:35
probably okay if the setbacks 10 or 20 ft you're already good
1:50:42
right okay yeah that that would make sense someone summarize for me what we just decided got a little lost all right
1:50:49
so let me try I think what we're saying is in uh a specified type of lots so
1:50:57
maybe the R15 and the r175 so the 50 by 100 Lots or the 75 by 100 lots that have
1:51:04
5ft setbacks M um it would say if you want to build on that 5 foot setback
1:51:11
there would be an approval process a certificate of appropriateness uh a
1:51:17
small planning board step not a big one and but only for those and if they
1:51:22
choose to be would it be 10 ft if they choose to to go to 10 ft they would
1:51:30
avoid it yeah yes y okay so it apply to only really those two those two zones
1:51:37
yeah those are the most of the zones in the center of Beacon by the way yes so where Molly lives yes these are not
1:51:42
small Z they they they like the center of Beacon is basically all R15 and r175
1:51:48
exactly right can I put a little wrench in this should we also consider adding
1:51:55
that for the existing structure that do not conform to the yard requirements
1:52:02
like they may actually be closer than the 5T if they're
1:52:07
non-conforming but maybe they should make sure that they're getting a certificate of
1:52:13
appropriateness if they're maybe we could set to become a living unit or
1:52:19
something so let's see if we can work that so that would be a non-conforming
1:52:25
non-conforming to the setback existing structure would also require that certificate of appropriateness unless
1:52:33
it's at least 10 ft yeah you can I don't think you can do the 10t yeah you might
1:52:39
not be able to so it would still need that certificate of appropriateness they would need the certificate of appr it's
1:52:45
really but what we're trying to achieve is having instead of giving them outright approval to do it it brings
1:52:50
them it gives them this other level of scrutiny and the opportunity to you know direct their building away from the neighbor
1:52:57
and so on so it achieves what it might work so does that do what you're thinking what you were concerned about
1:53:03
yeah okay yeah cuz that's already there that's H in the law so all right so we's
1:53:08
we're defining this concept of a certificate of appropriateness and we're applying it in a couple of small lot
1:53:15
sizes and then also the situation where um there is a not there's a existing
1:53:23
structure exceeding the setback in any District
1:53:30
yes well it's within 10 but they have to be 10 ft away it could be in any
1:53:35
District just just in these two right no I think it makes sense for
1:53:42
it to be in for the existing non-conforming building to be in any
1:53:47
Zone unless it's at already at least 10 ft yeah from the property line I think
1:53:53
that's the logical one right which is oh the setb back's 20 ft the garage is 10 ft off the property line close enough
1:54:01
right that's okay is what you're suggesting put it 5T from the line even
1:54:07
though they should have been 20 ft they need a certificate of appropriateness
1:54:13
that's right the only caveat I would have is that on these larger Lots it's unlikely that the residential dwelling
1:54:19
unit on the adjacent parcel is that close because they're larg Lots so in that case you might want to then have
1:54:25
the separation distance from an adjoining dwelling unit cuz the goal here is to avoid coming to boards yeah
1:54:32
and so if someone is 200 ft away from the nearest one but they're 5T away from a property line is that's really not
1:54:38
making a difference that's not addressing the concern you have so you're you're adding I am it's okay
1:54:43
you're you would suggest adding a second criteria right meaning less than 10 ft
1:54:49
and right yes there's somebody nearby yes right yeah so I'm looking at the
1:54:55
intersec like the block between Cliff South Elm DWI and Beacon Street it's all
1:55:00
R15 if I'm the first person to build the back of my lot I build an accessory unit
1:55:06
I'm fine I'm within 5T if I'm my neighbor with my back lawn building in that case my neighbor needs to get this
1:55:13
certificate just to check that everything works out and I'm not creating issues between our our two
1:55:19
accessory units and they could if they can't meet the 10 foot that back go to
1:55:24
the zba for a variance yeah if they right so at least 10 fet and how far
1:55:31
from another dwelling unit I mean I'll work with Natalie on what seems to be a logical number we'll have to look in come up with that number but I I I think
1:55:38
we're going the right way yeah all right I'm still happy to refer this to
1:55:45
the planning board and schedule of the public hearing yes we we all agree that we're close enough where we're going to
1:55:51
start the proc this up right yeah and then Nick's going to come back ni can Natalie uh okay great okay thank you
1:55:59
good this was good also especially thank you for the detailed diagrams that was
1:56:05
so helpful I I just want I just want to say you're all becoming zoning Geeks be
1:56:10
really careful Natalie do we need to do something to fix
1:56:16
rd5 with the 30 foot setbacks on 50ft lots that one is weird so can I suggest
1:56:22
that's the extra step that we do another review of these the setback issues by lot size it doesn't quite seem right yet
1:56:29
right and um could you all propose what you think is right Natalie and I think
1:56:35
that's more you Natalie than Nick right yep yes I already started it that that can be the next packet for sure okay so
1:56:42
that would be the other thing we're going to review the next time sure okay that'd be great that's actually where you live uh Angela court is rd5 trying
1:56:50
to find one there are not 30 gr zbags yeah but you know I'm thinking my
1:56:57
own house we have old houses the garages are right on the property line but the
1:57:04
houses adjacent to it are urban renewal lots and so not the same size not the
1:57:09
same lot size and so that measure of how far away is the house becomes relevant
1:57:14
right so I I think we've done uh good work here so we okay mhm onward okay
1:57:21
last item is priorities I think this is reasonably simple um so um the same
1:57:29
worksheet we gave you before we added a column um uh and so for all of the
1:57:36
existing items before you get to the Future project section the last section
1:57:41
we added something and we're letting you know where are we so we're we're not going to give you a detailed you know
1:57:46
80% done or this or that just starting up where we are some of them are already done
1:57:52
uh like the roof at the sewer treatment plant is done um you know so we're
1:57:58
making our way through these things and that should give us a sense of what we might be able to tee up next but your
1:58:05
focus because again we're executing against these right we might take something off the table depending on
1:58:11
what we discover in the process of trying to do the project but in the back
1:58:16
is okay what are we going to try to tee up next I think that's where you all have some say uh and that's hard because
1:58:23
you know they're kind of fluffy and we don't know what they are yet we added two things do you need Natalie for the
1:58:29
priority conversation Natalie I would say good night okay thank Natalie thanks
1:58:35
Natalie youal she was asking permission to go away she was asking yes everybody good thank you
1:58:41
thank for Sunday yeah that worked well so I did two things um uh Chris had
1:58:49
asked about a couple of things they were already in the top section he asked about trees and something else um and
1:58:56
then George you asked about Rec Center there was a renovation line I added as a
1:59:02
Rena or a new right take your pick uh we're not going to do both and then the comment about communication plan we
1:59:08
added that to the list right and so if you're looking at this future projects
1:59:13
there's probably two thoughts you might all have which is what might we do sooner that rather than later and then
1:59:19
of things that are longer term which way we we prioritize right and so rather
1:59:25
than say we're going to prioritize them all the question for the council is what do you think right and we can tee them
1:59:31
up it takes a little while to do it because they're all undefined or whatever the one I will say is the
1:59:39
communication plan which you put some money in the budget Chris uh and I have already started to talk about that uh
1:59:46
and so if you were kind of wanting to do something there it doesn't mean it's a tomorrow it's probably means it's a end
1:59:52
of the year or start of next year but we could we've at least started thinking about that because it was added to the budget that's what I was thinking too
1:59:58
yeah I think the fact that money is there we need to spend it yeah and you know in our discussion Kristen tell me
2:00:04
what you whether I said this I say it correctly most of it is not an expenditure of funds it's an expenditure
2:00:11
of time that's right and um it's interesting we may have that time
2:00:16
internally if they otherwise have some time as opposed to having to hire
2:00:22
outside time um so like one of the things we've talked about is is actually
2:00:28
producing um information for both a digital and a paper Guide to Everything
2:00:33
that's public facing from every department and it basically would be think about somebody who moves into the
2:00:40
community that doesn't know all the things that people have lived here when do Christmas trees get picked up how do
2:00:46
I sign up for the pool is there an after school program for my kids where do I license my my dog who do I call if I I
2:00:54
have an odor complaint for the wastewater treatment plan um you know how does my water bill what's the E on
2:01:01
the water bill mean so so we literally could think about doing something that goes through it it's like a resource
2:01:08
guide and it would be everything in the city and then some other things we talked about you know if you needed a
2:01:14
passport we could talk about okay you could call the Congress person's office or you could um certain state things we
2:01:22
could refer um and we scoped this out a little bit and we even have somebody who
2:01:27
is a graphic artist on staff who that's where the little bit of money would come
2:01:33
in it probably be overtime once we design that text and we get all the necessary input from the Departments it
2:01:41
doesn't all live on that it would some of it would live it would say if you want the schedule for instance of
2:01:48
recreation here it is on the website and that way that could be dynamic whereas
2:01:54
this is more static it would be you do it once you update it once a year but it drives you to the websites where it's
2:02:00
more frequently updated you suggesting that be a printed thing I'm I I am
2:02:06
actually I I think it could be both you could have it digitally we talked about having it so it's usable on a smartphone
2:02:13
but then also you use some of the money to print something so that people that don't necessarily have a lot of
2:02:20
experience with digital information also have a book yes I think that's you know
2:02:26
yeah I think I'm I don't I don't know that we necessarily want to design this here but I will just say that um I I
2:02:34
think that's a really good idea and something that the community is asking for in needs I think there are also some
2:02:40
other things that are being asked for and needed and so part of what I would hope we can
2:02:48
Envision is how do we get some foundational ways for the capital c City
2:02:54
to communicate with our constituents and I'll give you a a great example is in the fish kill Avenue Concepts committee
2:03:01
the team is talking about how do we publicize this information session we have and the city doesn't other than the
2:03:07
recreation department doesn't really have a way to just email people once a month and say Here's stuff that's coming
2:03:13
up so part of it I think is like the foundational elements I definitely think that's a big component of it is like
2:03:19
centralizing resources and helping people know where to go but I think there's there's probably some other things um and you know I am very
2:03:27
sensitive to the fact that our our city staff uh works very hard on a lot of
2:03:34
high priorities every day and when we had this conversation you mentioned that there's like a lot of positions that we
2:03:40
might need to fill from a staffing perspective during the budget um I would
2:03:46
I would wonder if this is something that we could um Outsource a couple hours a month for somebody to do if it's if it
2:03:54
is a a better and higher use of our staff time to do something else so I'll
2:03:59
just offer that but I do agree that I think that this is something that um you know isn't a huge Capital project it
2:04:06
isn't a huge study it is hopefully as you put here medium effort just kind of
2:04:11
figuring out okay are we Outsourcing this if so who and then like what what are the things that we want to try and
2:04:17
and get done as steps to foundationally be able to communicate with the residents of the city not just residents
2:04:22
community members yeah I'm not I'm not sure about the Outsourcing because the the way the
2:04:29
information is collected as probably department heads provide bits of information again wreck is a clear
2:04:37
exception because they have so much information and calendaring they have to do but again the the job is not to
2:04:44
design how we do it here is to talk about what are we trying to do the extra point that I heard you say was the email
2:04:50
blast concept of can we do something like it that I think will come later I
2:04:56
think the water meter project uh is going to get people um putting their um
2:05:05
registering to get water meter information and that's going to give us emails um well you have to get people's
2:05:12
consent to email I I understand but we have very few of them now and again you
2:05:18
have a disparity between residents and those who pay the water bill so like you
2:05:23
could have an apartment building and the one person that owns that gets the water the bill yeah so so how one distributes
2:05:32
the channels right and you know all this um right is different than the information itself right yeah and and we
2:05:39
may have to think about both elements right and and we do have things in place
2:05:44
that we should just lay out better um we we do have the Rave 911 system so for
2:05:50
instance if we're having a water shut off that's planned and not just an emergency um we will put a call into
2:05:58
that neighborhood when we've had things like um during Co the mayor used it
2:06:03
quite frequently y um we do have channel 22 it's un not not well used we have
2:06:11
social media we have our website um so I I think it's packaging it all around one
2:06:18
of the first things was kind of developing the content of of what could go out too
2:06:26
um I I would like to look if if we have the budget for it I would like to look
2:06:32
to add a position in in this office we used to have three people um the mayor's
2:06:38
assistant and and an assistant for the city administrator we basically upgraded
2:06:43
that POS one of those positions and didn't fill the other one but if we we have to again I'm I'm very circumspect
2:06:51
about what's happening right now with money and the economy but if we have the capacity we would like to think about
2:06:57
adding a person too so that you could do that normalize those
2:07:03
um you know those outreaches and and do do that more proactively yeah I I I
2:07:09
really appreciate you bringing that up Chris and I think it's something that I'd love to hear more about you know
2:07:15
again I'm just thinking of all of the positions that you were saying we need and so like how do we get a plan a a
2:07:21
plan in place to make sure that we are supporting the city in the best way that
2:07:27
we can yeah and and for me I just want to see how the year goes I want to you
2:07:32
know we're we're doing the firefighter contract and the Police contract we're
2:07:37
we're well behind in our pay for the firefighters we we're about to lose two firefighters to the city of pipy uh
2:07:45
because there's a $19,000 disparity between the top now I'm getting off subject but I it's just you know I I
2:07:53
want to make sure we're doing the the basics before we expand yeah I guess to
2:08:00
um so it sounds like most people are in agreement that like the communication plan is an important one to move forward
2:08:06
the other like frame of reference when I look at these future projects is just thinking ahead to when we have comp plan
2:08:12
in a couple of years and are there questions that we really should maybe not fully answer but have
2:08:20
some information on before we go into comp plan and for that reason some of
2:08:26
the sidewalk and and kind of I'll I'll continue to refer to it as Mobility or or access um in
2:08:34
addition to bikes I think there's other means that we might want to consider for people to get around so for those
2:08:39
reasons I I feel like those are probably two that that could be important just to prep us for that I would agree with that
2:08:46
and would add probably the rec center um into that as well just a point of like what are the issues about having a new
2:08:52
thing versus an existing site um I think those are things when I think of the comprehensive planning process too I had
2:08:58
the same thought of like what do we want to tee up for that process from city council I just know that we're
2:09:04
struggling to get South Avenue out to bid I mean we have three the South Avenue project was four disparate
2:09:11
contracts one is under contract three are out to bid Mark is Mark has a
2:09:17
department with three other people and and again I don't we don't have any time
2:09:22
at all this year to work on the community program I'm just telling you like we're
2:09:29
with the skate park and with South Avenue Park um I I never know what's
2:09:34
going to go sideways we play went totally sideways last year yeah what
2:09:40
what I'm hearing is if I I'm thinking about what you're asking about and saying where does it slot in it doesn't
2:09:46
slot like um studies to get ready for comp plan
2:09:51
would slot in especially if we can find money from somebody else probably slots in next year right and Chris is kind of
2:09:58
saying the the plates full right now the uh the issue of a of a a building for
2:10:05
recreation as opposed to all the programs that we've done um probably
2:10:11
again you know the thinking about it probably starts to slot in next year and
2:10:17
use the how many years it took us to do the firehouse as a sense of how long are
2:10:22
we talking about and it's going to take some time it's not going to get built in a day and it's not going to get
2:10:27
considered in a day so that's what I'm just saying I'm hearing and and you have things queued up already like the rehab
2:10:34
of Riverfront Park I mean that's that was put into the capital program I think at least 5 years ago and and it was
2:10:42
supposed to be done it's all designed but nobody's had the bandwidth to do it
2:10:47
yeah that was related to that there are a lot of these that I think are good ideas and we could build engineering or put
2:10:54
money towards money and time towards engineering plans you know bathrooms on Main Street and future but my question
2:11:00
to you Chris is is it worth doing that I understand what your priorities are
2:11:06
we've we've put this out and we're trying to get as much done as fast as possible without being fiscally
2:11:15
irresponsible I I will assure you that I have pushed this city harder than it's
2:11:20
ever been pushed in the last four years and you can see the results I mean we're
2:11:26
we have done more capital projects in the last four years and stuff around it
2:11:32
like support for the farmers market support for the flea market Nick knows that we've done over a 100 contracts
2:11:39
that were out of contract when I walked in the door so so again we're running as fast
2:11:46
as we can I I never say oh we haven't done enough um
2:11:52
and and again I it's just we'll get to it but we have to do it in a thoughtful manner or we go beyond budget or we
2:11:59
start making really bad mistakes that can be expensive so with that in mind what is a good rule of thumb for how far
2:12:05
in advance we should be thinking about what priorities we want for the future
2:12:11
you you can set the priorities but you can't say I want to do a study of
2:12:17
sidewalks a study of Mobility a study of you know community Communications a study of the the rec center and the
2:12:25
speed limit study all next year I mean that just I don't think that's what we're discussing we're just discussing
2:12:31
future projects that the mayor gave us no we it's listed right I I got it Pam
2:12:38
but Molly was specifically asking if we could do something about the community
2:12:43
center and again you can at some point but well it's number 121 I I know it's
2:12:50
on the list there's a lot of this list is like a 10year list to get through
2:12:55
yeah I guess I guess I'm confused about why we're having this conversation then because I I thought this was for the
2:13:01
council to kind of help advise like where we were but if that's not the case then I don't know why we're May was
2:13:07
asking the council to prioritize the study so that we can go down them in
2:13:12
order we come away from these meetings and Ben and I don't know what the priorities are because everybody at the
2:13:18
table seems to have a different priority a priority means you put one thing and then the next thing and then the
2:13:25
following thing I think we just gave four things okay but they're never in order so okay so let's let's get an
2:13:31
order and then we'll go down the list yep I mean do you want the communication plan first or a sidewalk plan or a
2:13:38
Mobility plan or the communication we were saying yes cuz it's budgeted money this year um I would agree so I I can
2:13:47
assure you that budgeting for it doesn't mean that there's time and resource to get it done right to put time and
2:13:54
resource to get it done we might be able to do it by end of year it might take
2:13:59
till the start of next year I think that's about where we can get that done if you're looking for like say bike or
2:14:07
sidewalk or one of those plans my suggestion would be that we agree on which ones in what order and then we
2:14:14
attempt to tee them up and get funding for them which again takes this time so my guess would be that those would be
2:14:20
things we with te up for next year because we'll be looking for funding to get it done for this year and they need
2:14:26
to be scoped out like I I can have conversations with our partners at the county if I understand what do you want
2:14:32
to go with next and then what's the goal and then let me talk to them and say how
2:14:37
do you do this the sidewalk plan probably isn't that hard a Mobility plan
2:14:43
unless you define it I I have no idea how big that could be I mean
2:14:48
that's so so the more you define it the more we have guidance for when we have time to do the next thing yeah and the
2:14:54
traffic remember the 25 M hour piece is a pretty good uh model right we
2:15:00
discussed it we said we get to it we got a piece of funding for it or we're close to getting a piece of funding for I I
2:15:07
don't know I think you have also have to realize that Federal funding has changed radically in the last two months I have
2:15:14
no idea if we're going to get a cdbg allocation I have no idea if we're going to they're even going to announce the
2:15:21
tip grants that we applied for for beakman Street whether or not the upw the unified planning work program goes
2:15:28
through I don't know so the way that I would translate that is we put things
2:15:34
into our Hopper and just the reality is they may not come right and that's okay
2:15:40
um because that's just the reality that we'll have to address but again if if
2:15:45
you want to work on Communications I think we can get to that you know given what we've described
2:15:51
sometime by end of year or start of next if you're looking for one of the plans
2:15:56
let's try to identify which one and let's try to te it up for you know next
2:16:03
whatever uh next fall no next spring next funding application cycle like if
2:16:08
they do open a tap Grant a transportation Alternatives program then I know what you want to apply for and
2:16:14
we've already scoped it out we kind of have an idea what how much it would cost um how long it would take right the
2:16:21
sidewalks you suggested might be easier to do I think that's CU you're thinking
2:16:27
there's a tool that the county has we might be able to use and you have a basis you started studying it you have a
2:16:33
map it's filling in additional details and then it's us setting CR criteria on
2:16:38
the prioritization of where sidewalks go things like oh it's by a school or it's
2:16:43
near a park or it connects to Main Street or to
2:16:49
Transit and and Natalie can work on that but Natalie's been really busy just with the Fishkill Avenue cdor committee yeah
2:16:56
to the extent that it's planner resource that's six months away right I'm just being honest because she's got her hands
2:17:02
full right now right and we've got as a council a set of Planning and Zoning
2:17:07
things that we want to do that will take up some of that resource right so again I I think if you said
2:17:14
sidewalk that again we could kind of tee up in the next 6 12 months something like that right I'm still not clear on
2:17:21
what we're talking about when we're talking about a Communications plan as a product I think I think there's a disconnect between what everyone maybe
2:17:28
at the table understands about what that product is if it's a matter of Outsourcing it developing a scope and going out and paying for it RIT large
2:17:35
and maybe that's something that does take time and it would be something that's end of year next year but there's probably a lot of fruitful discussion
2:17:41
about determining having a presentation about what we do have as an internal resource and what your perspective Chris
2:17:47
on what we have and what we should be maybe expanding upon in a relatively Costless way you know there there's
2:17:53
maybe there's some really cost-effective ways of of enhancing our efforts and communicating with the with the community and I think there's a
2:17:59
constructive conversation we can have in Parts in segments over a number of meetings that will help us Define better
2:18:04
what we want out of a communication strategy again likely identifying some very cost-effective ways of enhancing
2:18:10
what we're doing so um yeah the only issue with that is it's not just the the dollar
2:18:18
cost of hiring someone it's the time of the crew in the city right of each department head of sure but I'm not even
2:18:24
necessarily talking about taking any of their time yet I'm talking about the conversations that we could have in terms of having an an you know forming
2:18:31
an agreement about what we want to prioritize even within that one element of what we're trying to develop yeah what what we're talking about what is
2:18:37
communication are we doing scope it out yeah I I'm okay this group having that
2:18:43
discussion right we're not going to implement anything but if we can at least agree on what do we think that means that's easier to scope right well
2:18:50
I I wouldn't even go so far as to say we wouldn't Implement maybe we can find something that's really easy to implement we might find an external
2:18:56
resource that we can come bring to bear like at the county that just helps what we do yeah and relative to to that you
2:19:03
know the the item 121 the parks talking about the community center or something like that I had asked a couple weeks ago
2:19:10
that we just do an inventory of programming that we have um that we're that the city is
2:19:17
doing that volunteers are doing that we imagine if we were to build something a center or something or if we were to use
2:19:23
our existing building um I think we just need to do an inventory of what we hope to have in
2:19:29
this uh the city what kind of services we like to provide if
2:19:34
they're if it's better Under One Roof or multiple roofs um I think we should discuss because I I think we were caught
2:19:41
with our pants down to some degree during the pandemic when all these volunteer efforts were you know they
2:19:48
kind of fill the big huge gaps but I think the city needs to be also more proactive in helping those uh volunteer
2:19:55
groups the the city I I do want to note the city was very proactive I mean we
2:20:01
did more than $25,000 in food distributions we supported all of those organization I I know and but but can we
2:20:09
can we be better at it you know but but again like you look at the list of what
2:20:14
we're doing with wreck we have the participatory budgeting that we're trying to implement which is the skate
2:20:20
park that's a lot of work that right there was two contracts that legal had to put together all kinds of procurement
2:20:27
all kinds of Finance then we have you know the stuff at South Avenue
2:20:32
Park tell me where Mark Price gets time to work on that we we're also running a
2:20:39
camp an after school program we can get there but but unless you want to cancle
2:20:44
South Avenue Park and these other things we actually have to focus a lot of time on those I mean we don't we don't really
2:20:52
have time to even do what we're doing now and it's we're we're a bit stretched thin and then and then inevitably like
2:21:00
if a staff person leaves like last year we lost the assistant director well that put us back months we actually had a
2:21:06
lower the number of um after school sites we did I I'm just again I'm trying
2:21:13
to show you all of the things that we're doing if you want to have a conversation
2:21:18
about scoping these things that's fine but let's prioritize them please cuz
2:21:24
I've never heard what the prioritization is is it the bike the mobility the
2:21:30
community center the the speed study that's still pending I mean there's
2:21:36
there's more ideas than we could finish in a lifetime here we're going with the ideas that are presented to us and it's
2:21:43
like I guess we shouldn't be presented with them I mean I I heard Molly's
2:21:50
thinking and it's not like we're saying oh tomorrow we should do this but hey there are some things that maybe we
2:21:56
should have queued up before the comprehensive plan is done because you
2:22:01
look at 10 years ago that comprehensive plan that that is so old Beacon I mean
2:22:07
it just has changed so much so what do we have to kind of ceue up in the next
2:22:12
one two years without hearing about what I know what we're
2:22:18
doing but we're just we're trying I mean I guess you're asking us to Vision yeah
2:22:25
but we're we shouldn't be visioning well no cuz you you said the right words when
2:22:30
you say one to two years right these are topics that we're not doing tomorrow right we've got a really we all have a
2:22:36
very long list for this year right so it's like okay if we're starting to think about what do we want to do in the
2:22:42
next couple years couple years we can do most of you know some of the things not
2:22:48
all of these things on this list but the items that were talking about we can get to those in the next couple of years
2:22:53
right not going to happen this year right even Communications we can scope a little bit right but the actual
2:23:00
doing end of the year would be the kind of the earliest because we got a lot of stuff to clean up and get done next year
2:23:08
if you said this study uh is important and in getting ready for the comp plan
2:23:13
then this other one should be done fine that means in the next couple years we could probably get those right and if
2:23:19
you all are saying those are important we'll get them into it not this year right you know except for something that
2:23:26
might happen by the end of the year right that's I think where we're at um
2:23:31
and we haven't talked about some of the big projects like are we going to start doing the engineering work on East Main
2:23:38
and the Churchill Street uh where they cross the tracks are we simply going to wait um those might be some of the other
2:23:45
things and and again like we only have the city engineer for so so so much time
2:23:51
each he's he's struggled just to get the design work done for replacing the sewer
2:23:57
and water mains on fiscal Avenue so that we can repave all the fishal Avenue by the end of the
2:24:03
year we we do think ahead many years but the Practical realities are to get these
2:24:09
projects done is sometimes just I'm I'm grabbing resources from wherever I can
2:24:16
and I'm stealing them from other projects and you you do that based on the exigencies of of that particular
2:24:23
project so what I'm hearing is if we started something toward communication
2:24:30
first right and if we could do a sidewalk study next especially if it's
2:24:37
with existing resource and then after that we could do I don't know if it's
2:24:42
Mobility I I I struggle with what is it mean maybe it's just you know a a bike
2:24:47
system or a bike path system you know after that I think I'm hearing that
2:24:52
order I I don't know where I hear a new building I hear a new building a long
2:24:57
way off and I'm sorry but I I I do no that's what I was suggesting that we
2:25:03
figure out what we need and then we see what buildings do we have knowing that a new building is a is a dream it might be
2:25:10
a 15year dream yeah and a lot of that is in the study we did two years ago I was
2:25:15
just thinking we probably need to revisit that St again we we did try to look at that that and and that has been
2:25:22
a foundation for expanding both programs and reinvesting in what I would say is
2:25:28
poorly maintained facilities yeah one of the things we could do this year is at least take a
2:25:34
look again at that as a council right we're not asking the city staff to do a bunch of work but us look at it and
2:25:42
maybe come back and have a conversation about the tradeoff between programs
2:25:47
because you can see we've been investing in programs right because that's where we thought was the valuable piece and
2:25:53
then thinking through well what does that say we mean three five 10 years in
2:26:00
terms of capital right Capital besides the parks because we're doing those capital projects but this is the a
2:26:07
building Capital project right maybe we could do that but that's a council task right I don't think we're asking the
2:26:12
city to do stuff could we also um review
2:26:18
the complete streets that was done many years ago it's easy if that could you
2:26:24
know there's things in there that we can look at visioning as as part of you know the
2:26:32
sidewalks and bicycles so yeah I heard that as related to Mobility right so
2:26:37
maybe there's something that again as a council we can start to Define what does that mean right CU you know I hear bike
2:26:45
Lanes but you're saying no no no it's more than that maybe there is a planner
2:26:51
who can give us a sense of what does that mean as a council step for us to get a viewpoint on what are we talking
2:26:58
about here and then that would help us Define when we might do something and what that might be yeah I don't think
2:27:04
anybody at this table is sitting here saying like I'm just going to say Mobility study and expect somebody to figure out what I mean by that like I
2:27:11
have no problem having a conversation to provide like a better scope of work or a memo that outlines like what it is that
2:27:19
the council is looking for like nobody is expecting like just to interpret like three words into exactly what and
2:27:26
there's you know six people here who have to or seven however many of us
2:27:32
there are who like have to kind of come to a consensus on what it is that we think so
2:27:37
I I yeah this conversation is like a little weird to me today maybe we need to like break down specific things
2:27:44
instead of just looking at a big list and say today we're going to talk about what what we mean when we say we want a
2:27:50
communication plan and then next week we talk about what we mean when we say we want to understand bike infrastructure
2:27:55
and options for getting around the city a little bit better maybe this isn't the best way to have this conversation because I I do find it weird and
2:28:02
frustrating yeah I was having a similar thought to you Amber that um if the what
2:28:08
I'm hearing is that it's important for the seven of us to have a conversation
2:28:13
that's not taxing um other administrative resources we had
2:28:18
identified at the end of last year these three buckets of communications mobility and housing yeah um and we said at the
2:28:25
time we have not yet defined what these are but we need to have a conversation amongst the seven of us about what we
2:28:32
mean to give Clarity um for next steps
2:28:37
um and I think what you just suggested of picking one um for the next three workshops let's say or four workshops to
2:28:45
do one at a time um maybe in two weeks we the seven of us come with what we
2:28:51
mean when we talk about Communications and in two weeks from then we come with what we mean by mobility and maybe 2
2:29:00
weeks after that we revisit the recreation study and talk about what we
2:29:05
mean um when we're interested in expanding that area of our our
2:29:11
programming um and let that be a an open conversation
2:29:17
without committing any City resources to anything particular before I totally think yeah I totally think that's what
2:29:24
we need to do as opposed to just looking at this the way we're doing this clearly isn't
2:29:30
working and and again I have no problem saying like here are here are the thoughts that we have and like typing up
2:29:37
a memo about it like none of this needs to be this stressful for anybody we don't know what
2:29:43
to put on the agenda every week I I I I could give you 15 things right now
2:29:49
that's that's exactly the problem you could give me 15 things we need them in
2:29:54
prioritization interestingly please finish I I would look I do the
2:30:01
operational stuff I know to bring you the contracts that we need to do the budgetary stuff The Hires when it comes
2:30:09
to these these kind of council priorities every week I ask the mayor
2:30:15
what do you want on the agenda and and he and I have a conversation that we don't know there's like eight things
2:30:21
that were discussed which of the eight things do we put on because you can't put them all on at once and then have
2:30:28
the conversation that that topic deserves the reason we put this forward was pick one of these that you want to
2:30:35
put on the agenda next we've had eight or 10 ideas here pick one just pick one
2:30:40
and we'll put it on and we'll try to prepare and we can have a conversation about it so we we started discussing
2:30:47
communication do you want to well can we just interject for a second um interestingly I proposed and shared with
2:30:53
some of the council members the idea of having a resolution where we have an agenda spot on the agenda to talk about
2:30:59
the agenda so that we can in a disciplined way I think a lot of us do work as project managers and have
2:31:05
discipline in our day jobs we can have we can walk and chew gum too we can do more than one thing at once as long as
2:31:11
we have a structure about what we're doing very much in line with what both Amber and Paloma are saying in terms of
2:31:17
spacing this out just like a construction project we can have structured conversations around the concepts that we're coming to Common
2:31:23
Ground on and I think we can do let's not go crazy and do three at once but I think we could actually put on the
2:31:29
agenda for the next Workshop to talk about both Communications and have homework for us to bring a a baseline
2:31:36
understanding about what we have as current resources and what our ideas are and in a let's set limits on ourselves
2:31:42
so we're not here till midnight but we can have structured And Timely conversations to move these things
2:31:48
forward so that we have a understanding and we can prioritize additionally what we want to do yep all right so I'm I'm
2:31:56
hearing let's see if we can advance the concept of what we're trying to say about Communications right because it's
2:32:03
mostly internal and we started it why don't we start there all right I think
2:32:09
that that makes sense and I recollect a a memo that was put together two or
2:32:14
three years ago that was a sort of Roundup of the communications that exist
2:32:20
um I don't know if Ben or Chris you remember that um I if I I will also look
2:32:26
for it um if we even just had that as a starting point um or not even a starting
2:32:33
point but a reference point yeah I think that would be helpful and hopefully it does still exist and is relatively up to
2:32:39
date um and Chris I have a request of you that you you brought up Pete and
2:32:45
Toshi secra Park that I knew about but isn't on here and I'm like oh it's like it's a future project but we have put
2:32:50
plans together so as I think it is helpful to kind of as a council to know all the balls that we have in the air
2:32:57
and so if there's a way to include not not that we'll talk about that directly now necessarily but just as we think
2:33:03
about the larger scope of things I think that would be be useful as well the list we gave you was intended to do that it's
2:33:10
not perfect there are things that aren't on it that we've discussed that have
2:33:16
come up we it was our best shot to say this is kind of where we think we're going the next few years yep so okay
2:33:24
let's bring it to a conclusion we're saying and it won't be two weeks it might be four right but we'll do
2:33:30
something to tee up the communication discussion again with Council we might give you homework we
2:33:37
don't know you U we just have to think about it right um and see if we can Define it better so that we know as a
2:33:43
group what do we think we're looking for right M okay so do you have a a full agenda for two weeks from now is that
2:33:50
why you're saying not two weeks but four weeks we would have this conversation uh it just means that we may have some homework to get ready for it and we have
2:33:57
to figure out when we do it two weeks we're not meeting it's I'm just trying to be of a five month week
2:34:04
Monday um the the business of the city continues regardless of what we want to
2:34:11
do right and so it it's not instantaneous right um again I am
2:34:16
part-time right and these guys work a lot so I'm just saying saying we'll get to it reasonably quickly if you want to
2:34:22
do it in 2 weeks maybe uh just don't know unless you want to do the work
2:34:28
right so just you know there needs to be a little bit of flexibility I don't think it's terribly time sensitive if it
2:34:35
desperately have to get done in two weeks of course we do it all right let me know you could assign our homework
2:34:41
for two weeks because we don't have a meeting are we got is that a free week coming we have Mondays well but have to
2:34:49
think about session oh yeah that's right so the City attorney is reminded we have an executive session so are we good y y
2:34:57
okay uh do we need a motion you do need a motion to go into executive I need a motion to go into executive session to
2:35:02
discuss legal matters motion to go into executive session to discuss legal matters and do no public business
2:35:08
thereafter okay second all in favor I I thank you all I all right I'll be as
2:35:15
quick as I can for
