## Accessory Apartment Regulation Amendments [1:17:04]

### Discussion
- City Planner Natalie Quinn presented an updated memo reflecting changes discussed in the previous workshop meeting
- Proposed amendments aim to make accessory dwelling units (ADUs) more accessible and increase housing options

### Key Changes Proposed
- Permit accessory apartments on all lots with single-family homes in all districts
- Retain owner occupancy requirement in either the primary or accessory unit
- Add definition for "owner" and "owner primary residence" to strengthen regulation
- Remove minimum and maximum square footage requirements for accessory units
- Allow building code to regulate minimum size and maintain 50% of primary residence as maximum size
- Remove parking requirements for accessory dwelling units
- Expand building inspector's approval authority for certain types of accessory apartments

### Concerns Raised
- Setback requirements in certain districts (R1-10 and RD-5) may prohibit practical ADU placement
- Distance between accessory dwelling units and neighboring properties in smaller lot zones (R1-5 and R1-7.5)
- Need for reasonable review process that doesn't create unnecessary barriers
- Potential impacts on neighborhood character when converting structures close to property lines to dwellings

### Solutions Proposed
- Keep 50% size limit relative to primary structure but allow units exceeding this limit with planning board approval
- Create "certificate of appropriateness" process for ADUs in R1-5 and R1-7.5 zones when within 5 feet of property line
- Exempt properties from this review if they voluntarily increase setback to 10 feet
- Require certificate of appropriateness for non-conforming structures being converted to ADUs
- Consider adjusting setbacks in RD-5 to make ADUs feasible (reduce from 30 feet to more practical measurements)

### Next Steps
- City Attorney and Planner to revise the draft law to incorporate council feedback
- Schedule public hearing on the proposed changes
- Refer amendments to the Planning Board for review
- Review setback requirements by lot size for future amendment consideration

## 2025 City of Beacon Priorities [1:57:21]

### Discussion

- Discussion focused on balancing new initiatives with ongoing operational demands
- Recreation Center was added as a possible future project at Councilmember Mansfield's request
- Communication Plan was added based on previous council discussions and already has budgeted funds
- Council debated how to effectively prioritize among competing needs and interests

### Current Progress and Operational Context
- Several projects completed, including roof at sewer treatment plant
- Many projects in progress with timeline impacted by staff capacity
- South Avenue project now involves four separate contracts, with one under contract and three out to bid
- Significant staff time dedicated to managing current capital projects
- City staff already "running as fast as we can" according to City Administrator White
- Water meter project progressing and may provide opportunity for improved resident communications
- Fishkill Avenue corridor study ongoing with committee work in progress
- Firefighter and police contract negotiations underway, with concerns about compensation disparities affecting retention

### Challenges Identified
- Limited staff capacity with existing projects already stretching resources
- City Engineer and Planning staff handling multiple complex projects simultaneously
- Funding uncertainty due to changing federal guidelines and grant programs
- Critical staffing issues: potential loss of firefighters to neighboring municipalities due to pay disparities
- Need to address basic infrastructure and services before expanding into new initiatives
- Risk of project delays when key staff members leave (example given of losing assistant director last year)
- Difficulty in determining which initiatives should take precedence
- Challenge of moving projects from concept to implementation with limited resources
- Uncertainty around federal funding for Community Development Block Grants and other programs

### Communication Plan Details
- Funds already budgeted for initial communication plan work
- Discussion of creating comprehensive resource guide in both print and digital formats
- Guide would include information on all city departments and services
- Examples of content: water bill explanations, recreation programs, garbage pickup schedules, permits process
- Potential to develop email system for regular updates to residents
- Opportunity to build email database through water meter registration process
- Existing communication tools include Rave 911 system, Channel 22, social media, and website
- Consideration of adding staff position to support communications efforts
- Focus on making information accessible to residents with varied technological capabilities

### Recreation Center Considerations
- Review previous recreation study from two years ago before making decisions
- Evaluate renovation of existing facilities versus new construction options
- Need to inventory current programming and identify service gaps
- Recognition that this would be a long-term capital project (similar to firehouse project timeline)
- Discussion of volunteer efforts during pandemic and role of city in supporting community services
- Understanding that a new facility is likely a "15-year dream" rather than near-term reality

### Mobility/Sidewalk Planning
- Potential to use county resources for sidewalk inventory and planning
- Discussion of revisiting the Complete Streets study as a starting point
- Need to identify gaps in existing sidewalk network
- Consideration of bicycle infrastructure and alternative transportation
- Recognition that this information would be valuable for future comprehensive planning

### Process for Moving Forward
- Agreement to focus on one priority area at a time for more structured discussions
- Communication Plan identified as first priority for upcoming workshop discussions
- Council to develop better understanding of what each initiative would entail
- Potential to develop "homework" for council members to prepare for topic-specific discussions
- Recognition that most new initiatives would be targeted for next year rather than immediate implementation
- Focus on gathering information and developing scope before seeking funding for studies
- Need to prepare for future comprehensive plan update by gathering preliminary data

### Next Steps
- Schedule dedicated discussion on Communication Plan for an upcoming workshop meeting
- Council to review existing communications resources and develop specific recommendations
- Develop scoping for sidewalk/mobility planning as potential next priority
- Review recreation study for future discussion about recreation facilities
- Balance new initiatives with ongoing operational and capital projects
- Present one priority topic approximately every 4-6 weeks for council discussion
- Staff to develop timeline for when resources might be available for new initiatives

## Next Meeting

The next official council meeting is scheduled for a future date. An executive session followed this workshop meeting to discuss legal matters with no public business conducted afterward.

## Public Comment and Participation

Residents are encouraged to attend future council meetings to provide input on these agenda items and to utilize the county resources discussed during the presentations.
