6:01
wow lsh good evening thank you mayor since I only have three minutes Taylor Palmer with C fader on behalf of DK
6:06
realy or is everybody knows them in our community Healey it's good to see you all in person for my fastest three minutes Healey appreciates this
6:12
opportunity uh to highlight some of the key points that were included in the letter that we submitted to you all dated February 13th as you all know
6:18
Healey uh is a long-term corporate citizen in the city of Beacon and over the last 40 years they've operated their Hyundai for Mitsubishi dealerships at
6:24
409 410 420 and 421 Fishkill Avenue uh he's of course been a regular quter of
6:29
Beacon High School ion Beacon Historical Society in the ambulance Corps uh back in 2023 when he considered potentially
6:35
selling its Beacon properties and met with City staff to consider a variety of prospective clients and tenants as well
6:40
as uses at time the council considered looking at what might be the next of the heal what might be next for the Healy
6:46
properties before it formed the Fishkill Avenue Concepts committee or the fact committee uh which Mr Healey uh Jay Healey who's on the zoom tonight uh was
6:52
a part of you all have likely seen our newest projects coming online uh the hilly properties including carvana and
6:58
the SGI uh which is located across the street next to Conlin as you also know and has been mentioned at Several of
7:04
your Council meetings and discussions regarding the fact committee or the official Avenue quarter uh Healey is currently proposing and exist uh to
7:10
reuse its 420 uh fiscal Avenue property for a fully zoning compliant uh mixed use development including a Duncan
7:16
Coffee House and accessory drive-thru with additional commercial space third floor residential units uh at the site
7:22
uh Mr ker will speak to a few minutes for his three minutes uh to the site specifics and our architect is also here
7:28
who can speak to the visuals um while we weren't able to present them tonight we will submit them all to you all and they're also on the planning board's uh
7:34
application materials to that end our letter details we here tonight to bring certain uh deficiencies uh and certain
7:40
defects in the fact committee segmented Quick Fix review uh for the benefit of your Council um in particular uh the
7:46
count the F committee has been looking at these quick fixes precisely around the heal properties rather than the corridor as a whole um with that we
7:54
highlighted certain considerations that might be of uh reference for you all this evening as you may consider a law
7:59
to Pro pit drive-throughs instead could you uh could the council consider creating special permit regulations for
8:05
these types of uses for drive-throughs maybe in the rear screening public benefits like rail tra linkages all which are part of this project limiting
8:12
for example drive-throughs to fast food restaurants rather than coffee houses which are distinctly defined uses in the
8:18
code enabling drive-thru only for adaptive reuse buildings because again certain projects May or properties may
8:24
enable this whereas others may not be uh best suited for it and importantly instead of targeting a pending application possibly grandfathering uses
8:31
that are pending before the planning board for example like the matter at 420 which is on for approval next month
8:36
indeed the fact committee including at a December 10th appearance at the planning board um when the board indicated that drive-throughs would work in this
8:42
quarter and hav't heard much of that before the council but the planning board itself uh indicated that they would not uh prohibit drivethru
8:50
throughout the quarter didn't make specifics regarding fast food or these uses um 15 seconds thank you of course
8:56
at the end of the day none of this can take place without comprehensive plan amendments you're all considering a law tonight I think it's been mentioned a few times at your Council sessions but
9:02
comprehensive plan amendments would be necessary prior to enacting any changes to the zoning as proposed separately we
9:08
would note for the city code that the public hearing can't be time elapsed thank you until the March 21st because
9:13
of the date in your code thank you thank you uh Dan
9:21
Co yeah we're having issues with good evening I'm sorry yep go right ahead Dan
9:28
thank you very much good evening I'm Dan ker with Hudson Land Design we're the site civil engineering consultant for the proposed adaptive reuse project
9:35
located at 420 Fishkill Avenue and we're here on behalf of the Hees this evening the project includes the rehabilitation
9:42
of the site to include a mixed use residential and commercial space including a Duncan Coffee House and
9:47
accessory drive-thru some of the many benefits to the city associated with this Redevelopment project include one
9:54
channelization of traffic from Fishkill Avenue in its current state there is a free-for-all where vehicle may enter and
10:00
exit from anywhere along the property's 350 ft of Frontage The Proposal calls for a dedicated entrance for delivery
10:06
and refuse vehicles and for channelizing all other vehicles to one access point
10:11
this improves the safety along this Corridor two impervious coverage and storm water runoff will be reduced the
10:18
site is entirely impervious covered by either building or a sea of pavement even extending off of the property into
10:25
the MTA property The Proposal calls for a reduction of the on site impervious coverage by adding approximately 20% of
10:32
the parcel area as landscaped area as designed by a landscape architect these
10:38
areas will provide EOG grasses shrubs and trees where not a single one exists today the pavement on the MTA property
10:45
will also be 100% removed as part of the project as a result there will be less store M to runoff allowing for some
10:52
infiltration and transpiration by the new proposed vegetation this will also greatly improve the Aesthetics by
10:58
providing thoughtfully landscaped streetcape along Fishkill Avenue three
11:04
pedestrian movement improvements the layout purposefully pushes site improvements out of the RightWay of
11:09
Fishkill Avenue leaving a blank canvas of approximately 13 ft of width between the fog line and the site curbing that
11:16
can be improved to the Fishkill Avenue Corridor committee's liking this may include a multi-use pedestrian way that
11:22
includes Provisions for walking and biking or a multitude of other options to improve pedestrian movements in this
11:28
corridor we're also providing a mid block pedestrian Crossing near Townsen street that provides a Nexus between the
11:35
existing sidewalk along the west side of Fishkill Avenue to the east side of Fishkill Avenue in the same area we're
11:41
proposing a connection to the Future rail trail through the site via granting of an easement to the city of Beacon
11:48
four pocket park the project is proposing a pocket park in its northeast corner the park will be landscaped and
11:55
equipped with benches and will serve as a potential resting area for the future Rail Trail Trail users or a place to
12:00
grab beverage and relax for those pedestrians using Fishkill Avenue for the tenants in the residential units or
12:06
Duncan customers 15 seconds this will transform an otherwise unused space into
12:12
a place that can bring local community members together Duncan is the anchor tenant that allows this project to move
12:17
forward from a financial perspective the proposed site work is very costly absent a drive-thru exess time is elapsed
12:24
Duncan will not be allowed to establish tennessy in this location which what the entire project of risk thank you thank
12:32
you and uh Chris rafaeli yes good
12:37
evening Chris rapael to the architecture uh with the project Architects on here on behalf of Healey so it's a bit
12:44
difficult to describe a building without actually having a picture of the building uh so you might be aware of
12:50
this uh dealership building um on the north end of the building there's the
12:55
garages and on the south end is the two floors of sales and former office uh the
13:01
building is run down um Battleship Gray um in need of repair so the we have been
13:08
working with the planning board over the past few months to refine the design of this and as Dan and Taylor mentioned the
13:14
north end of the building will be occupied by The Duncan coffee house we have a vacant undetermined yet retail
13:23
business space in the middle um and on the south end on the second floor there are three Apartments um on the lower
13:30
level is an undetermined uh retail business use as well the building is
13:35
configured uh so that queuing and the pickup window are generally on the rear of the building on the rail trail side
13:42
and then around the south end of the building uh the building design has been
13:47
um criticized and worked through with the planning board um they are now
13:53
preparing resolution for um approval of the design which is generally
13:59
uh brick dark metal banding dark metal windows uh sort of fits the fabric of
14:07
the current design intent of the planning board uh on the north end of
14:12
the building there is some Duncan specific branding including their
14:18
signage and some of the familiar colored bands that they have they're sort of
14:23
limited uh but to the northwest corner of the building um
14:30
I think that's about all I got thank you thank you very
14:35
much uh ktie hel and mayor I I just want to note that even though we're having
14:42
technical difficulties in the room the video is is fine um of what people are
14:47
seeing online so I'm sorry it's going in and out but we can't fix that without shutting down for five to 10 minutes
14:55
okay go right ahead hi uh Katie helmouth Ward one I'm
15:01
it's a little choppy because I wasn't able to write this so far in advance but I'm concerned and surprised that the
15:06
council is considering this move to zone out autor related businesses and storage facilities on Route 52 in the Fishkill
15:13
Corridor I'm not understanding why this is when I first learned of the desire to redesign this area after the Healey car
15:19
dealership had left it was when former city planner John Clark was presenting it while doing so he mentioned his
15:25
desire to not have places like the Family Dollar there anymore this struck me as dis inclusive of an entire group
15:32
of people including myself and my children who shop there then it was brought up that why not get rid of all
15:37
of the autor related businesses rather businesses either now and in the future
15:43
meaning in the future no Carwash no auto repair shop no rental place possibly no gas station and no possibly atire repair
15:50
center could not be there anymore so close to I 84 where we all drive back and forth to get onto the highway or use
15:57
it as a back road when 84 is backed up for logical reasons I'm just not understanding the pursuit of this path
16:03
for walkability while it is not like Charming if you think of Auto stuff we do walk and bike to auto repair shops in
16:10
Beacon and to car rental places I don't know why we would have to go all the way to pipy for these things to not have
16:16
this Auto access is a great inconvenience to us um we still do drive cars and we will be driving cars in 6
16:23
months and in 6 years while all businesses could be grandfathered in there exist stipulations that include
16:28
include if a business were to burn down more than 50% it could not reestablish itself and I don't know about if the B
16:35
business is trying to sell if they pause for 6 months I'm a little unclear about that as well if they would lose the
16:40
right to be in business anymore for drive-throughs as a parent of multiple children drive-throughs are highly
16:46
convenient to me I cannot get to all coffee shops with my children when I'm in route or a baby a single baby in a
16:53
car in a car seat I do not view drive-throughs as tacky or cheap I view them as part of life as for the Healey
17:00
family I just learned of this last week after I spoke at the planning board meeting about this that this is the Healey family's property who is
17:06
proposing the Dunkin Donuts and the drive-thru and the apartments I'm surprised that this was not acknowledged
17:12
during the debate of these drive-throughs and um and the suggestion of a moratorium to slow down the
17:17
possible building during the discussion of the moratorium I don't remember hearing any mention of the hey family at
17:23
all who was the current property owner instead it seemed rushed that we needed a moratorium so quickly to prevent any
17:29
more proposals coming in but I didn't realize this was their property already which brings the rush
17:35
and surprise way down it is the current property owner is suggesting a new use for their property as for storage
17:41
facilities people use stor 15 seconds uh I learned when I interviewed Guardian Self Storage lots of different people
17:47
from the flea market who are vendors people who are divorced all kinds of people use them and they go and they
17:52
tinker and they take stuff out and they put it back it's not a high employment thing but it does it especially as we're
17:59
building tiny one and two apartment your time has elapsed we have to store the stuff somewhere
18:04
thanks thank you very much uh Christine wayang has Jessica on the same line if
18:12

21:52
all there okay um anyone else the physical
21:59
public want to make a comment uh please come up let us know who you
22:05
are Teresa craft I firmly believe that incremental development is preferable to large-scale
22:12
projects that happen repeatedly I have urged the city to slow down the planning process for the Route 52 Corridor and to
22:19
avoid allowing it to be developed in a peac mill
22:25
fashion I brought up the same concerns during the car Arana public hearings for
22:30
the record the Healy family's name was mentioned and their long standing story
22:36
was told my dad was one of their first shuttle drivers so I get the heal family
22:41
history the same owner and developer along with their legal council assured the city that their other project
22:47
carvana would not negatively impact traffic and safety I strongly disagree
22:52
with this assessment we continually observed their large tractor trailers congesting our Main Street struggling to
22:59
navigate tight turns on Main Street near Church Hill Avenue now at a different
23:04
Main Street Transportation City Road access one of the second largest we are
23:10
watching the city and the city's planning board discuss beakman Street massive overdevelopment plans to be
23:17
built out at one of the busiest intersections on our maps with two four-story structures looking like a
23:23
Westchester Skyline and on at the same meeting agenda they reviewed a new project at the table literally less than
23:30
1 minute and less than 6 miles away they told the developer and the same
23:36
architect of both of those two projects to go back and revisit their
23:43
application because they did not want to change the character of Walcott avenue Route 9 Corridor calling it The Gateway
23:50
into the city of Beacon which is exactly what beac beakman street is the people
23:56
with oversight near need to hear themselves talk they need to watch and listen watch what one hand is saying
24:03
while the other hand is not listening thank you thank you very much anyone else in the physical audience want to
24:09
make a comment okay anyone online if you're on zoom and you'd like

24:47
note for those um that are participating um online you should turn your camera on
24:52
uh during comments and also for any of the votes that we may take um and let's start up uh uh George you want to start
24:59
on your side sure thank you um good evening I have just a few announcements to make um one is that um there's a
25:08
number of affordable Workforce housing um units have come online and if anyone
25:13
is interested in applying uh that they should contact Hudson River housing at 8454522700
25:28
uh they go from Studios to two bedrooms um the other thing is uh the
25:35
Fishkill Avenue Concepts committee will have a community feedback meeting on uh
25:40
March 9th I believe that's at industrial Arts Sunday uh from 2:00 to 5:00 so
25:47
anyone in the public that wants to uh contribute to that conversation regarding rezoning of fish kill Avenue
25:53
um this would be your opportunity to come and express yourself
25:59
um and then the last thing is not an announcement but I just had a question um I'm going to be meeting some
26:04
constituents next week regarding uh Communications uh via from
26:10
the city of Beacon and I understand that there's a $75,000 um uh earmark uh to improve our
26:18
Communications and I was just wondering if we're going to be speaking about that on Council anytime in the near future or
26:26
I I I wasn't part of the conversation during the um um the budget uh
26:33
discussions
26:39
okay um I wanted to remind folks that the public comment period on the fiord
26:45
trail is open for maybe another week or two um public comments need to be
26:50
submitted by March 4th um the hearing has already taken place so these are just your written comments um and and uh
26:59
I believe we still have a print out of the whole D geis here at City Hall if
27:05
somebody needs to look at it physically yes it's also available online um but just a reminder to um take advantage of
27:12
that comment period and that's all thank you thanks um I hope everyone is staying
27:17
warm and safe in these bitterly cold windy and icy conditions I know that we had a couple of our local um
27:24
organizations that actually chose to close yesterday because of the weather and prioritizing safety and including
27:31
the fact that we weren't able to have our rescheduled MLK event that had been rescheduled from um MLK's celebrated
27:37
birthday on the 20th till yesterday um however in kind of preparation for this event I was thinking just about the work
27:44
of Dr Martin Luther King Jr and his theory of change kind of built on Lo local and National coalitions and then
27:51
today I happen to have the opportunity to attend a rally that was organized through the office of our congressman
27:58
Pat Ryan um and in in response to the current proposal to close some of the
28:04
acute care beds at our Castle point of va or Veteran Affairs Medical Center just up the road from here and while the
28:11
thing that I wanted to call out in this moment is really appreciating the Coalition of people who came together while it was you know under the offices
28:18
of a congressman Ryan's office it really was about centering the work of many of our local veterans organizations and
28:25
actually because of the cold it was hosted here in Beacon at the VFW Center they graciously hosted it and many of
28:31
their members were present and the conversation that happened there just gave me real hope for the future of how
28:36
we can Advocate both for protecting services that we want and also potentially advocating for new ones in
28:43
the future and I I think that Dr King would have been proud for the continuation of our work and thinking of
28:48
his own work how he based it and it started in his own hometown of Montgomery Alabama and spread from there
28:53
and so it it gave me hope for the power of Beacon to impact not only locally but nationally as well and I'll pass it to
28:59
you Lee um okay let's go online um Paloma and then Jeff
29:06
maybe hi I'll just share that my um next office hours are Sunday March 9th from
29:14
4:00 to 600 p.m at tracks coffee but in the meantime and also anytime I'm happy
29:20
to set up time to speak to anyone about anything um through my email which is
29:26
pwa ny.gov okay jeck thanks all um
29:35
appreciate you all sparing me the uh need to cough in your presence um so
29:40
sorry to be remote tonight but think it's a good choice um I'm very glad that the folks from the spring celebration of
29:46
Light Came tonight I will not talk further about that but very much looking forward to that celebration and drawing attention to it uh and then just briefly
29:54
while I'm voice holding out here there's just two really good articles in the last couple of weeks that were in the
29:59
highlands current um one on February 7th talked about feeding Beacon emphasizing
30:04
a program that a former council member Justice McCrae came and spoke to us about but there's there's a couple of
30:10
great programs one that that Justice spoke about was the um Beacon's backyard
30:16
which is providing free breakfast to people Tuesdays Wednesdays and Thursdays from 6:30 to 8:30 at 12 Hanah Lane at
30:22
the yard which was the destination of the celebration of Light Parade uh and then there also the um the fairground
30:29
welcome table which is providing dinners from 5:30 to 7:30 on Fridays just wonderful Community Resources and then
30:36
on the 14th on Valentine's Day issue there was a great article about mental health challenges uh and resources
30:43
available for First Responders in particular but highlighting resources here in Beacon and in Duchess County uh
30:49
to support mental health uh for people um who are particularly on the front lines of challenges so and my office
30:56
hours are going to be on March 16 uh at from 11: to 1 at bank Square
31:03
coffee house thank you thank you Jeff um I I'll
31:08
be relatively brief um so just a couple of items one uh with Molly I also
31:13
attended uh today's event at the Beacon Memorial Building uh which was for uh
31:20
supporting veterans to maintain aute care facilities at Castle Point um you
31:25
know I I always find it such a pleas pleasure that our memorial building is used not only for veteran events but um
31:32
especially for veterans events when they occur so I'm just grateful for that and was happy to welcome folks there then
31:39
the other one is I I was away last week uh it's um you know just personally
31:44
speaking um my parents I think many of you know were immigrants uh Greeks from the island of Cyprus they came to the
31:51
United States in the late 1940s um my father had an uncle and Aunt
31:56
uh but the rest of my parents generation remained in Cyprus the hopes of my dad was to uh go to college but didn't occur
32:04
uh but when my parents as they got to be the uncle and the aunt uh four of my 17
32:10
first cousins came from Cyprus and live with our family to attend college um at
32:16
various times but they were all my older brothers and sister in terms of how we lived together and one of them passed
32:23
away uh and so I attended that funeral uh in in Tampa
32:28
uh I just say that just because uh it's an important part of my life and uh I apologize for not being here um but uh
32:35
he was sort of my big brother um so with that I'll turn it over to uh Chris and
32:41
uh we'll go from there I just have one announcement um we had talked about the
32:47
plus1 Adu program that we were going in with Hudson River housing on um that
32:53
award came out much quicker than I thought it would and so we have um been
32:59
awarded with Hudson River housing uh we're part of a $6 million award to
33:04
build um accessory dwelling units so um it it they'll have to work out the
33:10
arrangements with the uh State homes and Community Renewal Division and then we'll go on to contract with them but
33:17
we're moving forward that and um I know that the council is looking at the adus
33:23
and what we can do to facilitate them make them easier and and maybe remove some of the fees so this is really
33:29
timely thank you and Chris could you just give a brief description of what this uh program does I mean sure so an
33:36
an Adu or an accessory dwelling unit uh which is called an accessory apartment
33:41
in our code is typically a smaller unit that's um in a single family home or on
33:48
a single family property um it's developed in um kind of as a it was
33:54
often thought as an in-law flat so it you know typically it would be done for families but it can be used to create
34:01
smaller more affordable housing units and then also helped to make the um
34:06
mortgage and taxes for the homeowner more affordable because they have an income coming in what we did is we um
34:12
got in a Consortium with six towns the village of Reinbeck and Hudson River
34:18
housing to take advantage of State funding that was coming forward and that
34:23
funding is up to $125,000 per unit to help people people
34:28
um architecturally design permit construct um these units in their homes
34:34
or in ancillary buildings on their property it's from what I understand
34:39
it's a grant as well yes it's a grant it's Tech it it's a grant that is a loan
34:45
that um diminishes over 10 years but yes it it operates like a grant if you
34:51
comply with the program for the entire time you don't have to pay it back thank you uh so once we have more details on
34:58
the roll out will make that available to homeowners um if they're interested in
35:04
participating yeah um I would just add um that took a a while to arrange we
35:10
actually didn't have um a partner to do the administrator side of the program
35:16
and the city administrator reached out to Hudson River housing and we suddenly whipped together a crew to to make this
35:23
work so I'm just appreciative of the work um we still have some work to do on on uh hopefully simplifying and making
35:30
less less expensive our Adu process so that'll sit on our agenda item the one thing I will add given um George's
35:38
remark is we'll create a TBD list on our workshop and we'll have communications there I think it will take us a couple
35:44
of rounds to get there because we had some thoughts in the administration on how we might go about this and we just
35:51
want to formulate those so we can bring them and have you have something to look at at least as a potential idea great
35:57
thank you right but yeah we'll we'll put it on a list and we'll keep at it until we get there all right MH and thanks
36:02
Jeff that was your suggestion and I I think that's pretty straightforward to do um okay we've got a couple of
36:09
resolutions uh the first one is just a referral so this is a resolution referring a proposed local law
36:16
concerning uh drive-thru facilities and self storage businesses to our zoning law and this is a referral to the uh
36:23
Duchess County planning board and the and our own planning board can I get a Motion in a second on that motion second
36:29
so that was um Amber and Molly Nick would you add anything to that I would
36:36
mayor just that this proposed local law amends the City Zoning code in terms of permitted uses for drive-through
36:42
facilities self storage businesses and clarifies that new use not expressly
36:48
permitted or prohibited it schedules a public hearing for March 17 and refers it to the city and county planning board
36:54
for a referral in report okay and is there a time frame for
37:03
this the public hearing is scheduled for the 17th and then the planning board and
37:09
the county have 30 days to provide their review okay and our planning board next
37:14
meeting is the 11th maybe correct yeah so in the past um we've referred matters
37:20
with less than 30 days and if they don't complete their review either the county or the city planning board we then
37:27
extend the public hearing very good General Municipal law there's a 30-day referral requirement to
37:33
give them 30 days to consider the local walk okay any uh comments from Council
37:41
Members all right so this is pretty straightforward so all in favor of referring uh this zoning change on
37:48
drive-throughs and Self Storage uh to the planning boards of the county and the City of be can say I I I anyone
37:55
online I hi all right I heard two yeses from each
38:00
of you thank you uh I don't think there are any NOS so thank you very much and
38:05
the second one I'm looking for a motion and a second on granting a special use permit uh for 416 420 Main Street motion
38:13
second go ahead um that was uh amber and George Nick will you tell us what this
38:19
is about this is the new construction projects it's almost complete correct this is up for a property at
38:25
416 uh Main street with respect to a mixed juice um building fronting on Main
38:31
Street consisting of a 49 4200 foot ground floor retail space and about 600
38:37
square feet of commercial office Bas on the second and third floors and then 1200 square feet residential space on a
38:44
step back fourth floor the special permit was issued by the Council on March 1st of 21 it was set to expire and
38:53
the applicant received an extension on July 1st 2024 for for six months and
38:58
they've now come back for a further extension um and time was submitted their application and are requesting a
39:04
thir or six month extension that would expire in June of 25 by which time they anticipate construction will be
39:10
completed in accordance with your city code the building inspector was consulted and as set forth in the
39:17
resolution confirmed that the applicant has proceeded with due diligence proper erosion control measures are in place
39:23
and the six-month extension is reasonable and that the delays were caused by factors outside of the applican control and as expected the
39:31
project will be completed within the additional time frame
39:36
requested Nick I have a clarifying question about not the special use permit but the building permit um I
39:43
understand for the materials you shared that that also expires more or less the same date in June if for some reason
39:49
they're not able to to finish everything by June in terms of the building permit
39:54
is that something our building department can extend or would that also come back before us or the planning
40:00
board because it falls under a special use permit no well a special if it don't
40:05
get the work done before the special permit and before the building permit expires they would have to come back to this Council to get the special permit
40:11
extended but the building insector has is the sole one who has the authority to extend the building permit under your
40:19
code great thank you all right my only comments are um
40:25
I'm just a um thinking that we you may want to adapt our law slightly we do that with some regularity and what I'm
40:31
hearing in this is that the time frame we have for either special use permit or building permit may not be long enough
40:39
given how um complicated construction takes place so I may uh want to add an
40:44
item that we'll get to to just to take a look at that I don't know whether the answer is to give the discretion to the
40:51
building inspector to extend you know if inappropriate or or just to change the time frame but I seems to me that um you
40:58
know we're creating kind of undue bureaucracy here for no particular reason all right so I just like us to
41:05
consider that at another date other than that any other
41:11
comments All right so all in favor of granting a special use permit extension for 416 420 Main Street say I I I online
41:21
hi hi all right I hear them all uh and I heard no NOS uh so that carries
41:27
unanimously thank you then I will need a motion and a second for the approval of
41:33
the February 3rd minutes motion second Molly and Amber any comments questions
41:40
