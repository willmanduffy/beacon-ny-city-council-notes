8:55
I need to finish filling this out fa right now six day of
9:02
January
9:19
2025 okay now the first item of business says here is the appointment of George
9:25
Mansfield to the position of w for city council member um so I think I wrote to all of you um
9:34
anyone who you know I we announced it a couple of times I left it open for a while anyone who expressed interest I
9:42
responded to and offered them an interview if they wish uh several did I
9:47
I interviewed everyone uh a couple of people I interviewed several times or more than once uh and it seemed pretty
9:56
easy for me to get to George Who was uh willing to serve and has done 14 years
10:03
of service behind this table and then before that two years on the planning board um like our appointments a year
10:10
ago um you know I I want to recommend somebody who knows exactly where they're
10:15
doing and can come to the table and start right off the bat I don't think I need more of an introduction than that
10:22
um so what do you all think um I think that you did um thank
10:29
you thank you for summarizing the process that you went through and for um opening the process this time around um
10:36
and for um being really responsive to anyone who reached out um I know that
10:42
you you summarized uh what your criteria were and the qualities you were looking for as someone who knows what they're
10:48
doing and can come in and do the job on day one um but I'm wondering if you can expand a little bit more on that um in
10:57
terms of what exactly you were hoping for um and what your sort of
11:02
thought process was and looking at all of the interview weuse sure um there was a an interesting variety so you know it
11:09
wasn't like there was a dozen people it was more like a half a dozen just to disclose and um there was some variety
11:17
in terms of background um and my two cents was I was interested in someone
11:22
who could hit the ground running quickly there was always this tradeoff of of if
11:28
you go with someone you know or that's been at the table there's certainly a lot of experience um you can say well it
11:35
would be nice if we go with someone who was new but the hard part when you're doing that is that appointment by this
11:41
one individual and approval by you all kind of gives them a um a free election
11:46
basically a a role to play that's not necessarily a bad thing um but it was
11:52
like you know it'd be harder to say someone who doesn't really have experience at the table and hasn't run
11:58
for election before so that was my thinking and it was I'm pretty consistent on it doesn't mean I would
12:04
always do it but you know you heard me say it's it's a decided preference and it's usually an advantage and I think in
12:11
this case um it it made a difference that isn't to say that some of the other people I talked to I wouldn't have been
12:18
more than happy to recommend in fact I think most of the people I talked to could easily um um you know get your
12:25
approval and um contribute to the community some already had done so in
12:31
multiple ways so um you know I just wanted to provide that I don't think I
12:36
want to tell you the details but you know you know exactly who but I think
12:41
I've talked to some of you before and you've probably heard around some of the people who might have expressed interest
12:49
so that's good I I appreciate the additional background and I certainly have respect for George have definitely
12:56
he was my go-to person that I went to for advice when I first moved to speaking more than a dozen years ago and
13:01
had you know very constructive conversations with him um but that said you know we had the we had the
13:06
appointment last year at about the same time and we talked about process um you said you only had about half a dozen
13:12
interested party and a lot has to do with that context you know the culture that we create and I think we're living
13:17
in a time where we especially need some creative thought and some input and I know there's value to hitting the ground
13:22
running and familiarity with process but I also think that there is a missed opportunity for not having good and constructive conversations I know
13:29
there's a charter and you have the right to make the decision as you have done but there was no consultation or broader
13:35
conversation that was had to explore the candidates in a in a more formal way even you know in the executive session
13:42
so I for for me I'm I'm not content with the process as it was I just I think it's a missed
13:49
opportunity well certainly you're the council and your process can be your
13:54
choice um but you know you can look at it and say given this context up to here
14:00
and I can hear that input um but again that's your choice
14:07
so other comments um I I one other line of
14:15
thinking um that I've heard is that there is AE some people have a
14:20
preference for somebody who would um go through the process of running again and
14:25
has an intent to stay in the role and to have that Contex annuity we had that with Amber we had that with Pam
14:31
obviously um was that a consideration at all in your thinking yeah that was
14:37
important to me too okay so I'm with you on that does it does did George express
14:43
interest in running yeah so he's going to run so just to make that clear that
14:48
that's what you're saying and I asked that of all the candidates because I thought it mattered to me as well yeah
14:54
so but for me that that makes it even more problematic and that we're giving him a leg up you know for the
14:59
re-election without having that ability for other candidates to to be vetted and have conversation and opinions expressed
15:05
in a more formal way well um you know that'll depend on whatever the process is for election so
15:12
it's both a local committee Choice which has to do their interviews and then you know there's a there's a signature
15:18
collection and an opportunity for a primary so all that is not in our control this is the only part that is in
15:24
our control
15:31
Okay we okay to go forward yeah I'll I'll just say that I um appreciate Jeff
15:37
what you're saying and that this um was an opportunity to have an even
15:43
greater uh process um I think you know that that's something that's important to me um but for me in this instance um
15:51
I feel like this process this time around was progress from um what felt to
15:56
me like a lack of progress last time around um and so I I do intend on uh
16:03
voting on this appointment okay thank you all
16:09
right yeah you know I you know just a final comment I'm I'm not sure how we
16:14
could work at and maintain the the roles in the charter and i' I'd look to Nick
16:20
for that but um obviously the council could do a process after I make a
16:25
recommendation right well the correct the council you make
16:31
the ultimate decision and give them the individual you select they they don't have a role with respect to your selection other than reviewing that
16:38
selection coming up with a criteria whether they think that individual is suited to serve in the position they
16:43
can't tell you who to Su who to select or if they reject this person who you would then have to put for if that's
16:48
within your control yeah okay so you give them an individual to consider and they then have the option to evaluate it
16:55
at that time okay thank you Nick all right AB anything else we can go on
17:00
that's all right so we have a couple of planning board appointments um one is
17:06
Karen Keana and the other is Randall Williams both of them have served for uh some time um it took us a while to
17:13
realize that Randall had been appointed by CLA lug and has done this for um 20
17:18
years um or almost that long and then Karen I appointed um she has a a great
17:25
background she's a an architectural landscape uh professional and I think both of them have you know contributed
17:31
well and are willing to do that so those are those two for the planning board any comments on
17:37
those I just note that um I've listened to a handful of planning board meetings and really appreciate both of their
17:43
expertise kind of that they bring to the table and asking questions along with actually all the planning board members
17:49
and in particularly with Karen appreciate her landscaping and tree expertise that's something that I don't have at all and just thinking about us
17:55
as a tree City and her kind of thinking very specifically and thoughtfully about that yeah yeah I have the same reaction
18:02
in terms of it's it's a nice perspective and she gets a to focus on certain elements of site plans that others might
18:09
not see as clearly yeah and I would add for Karen it's not just you know Aesthetics about
18:15
trees and what um is pretty but she has an understanding of um environmental impact more broadly um and I appreciate
18:22
that perspective on the planning board as well okay um if I can go on is that
18:28
all right so we got three to the zoning board these are all reappointments um
18:33
and so um Stow Boyd I appointed uh as I think you might recall and Pam you'll
18:38
recall well he was chair or co-chair with Pam of the uh Main Street access committee and you know learned a lot of
18:45
the ropes uh when he you know when Stow did that um Elaine I also appointed um
18:52
you know she'd been involved in um you know different things in terms of advocacy uh and I think is a good um
19:00
addition to the board and then montos well I mean he's Greek that's that's isn't that enough no um um montos
19:07
actually has the longest tenure on on the zoning board of appeals he did it for a while stepped back and then was
19:13
willing to come back on and so there's a level of expertise and also just you
19:18
know consistent volunteerism that I have a lot of respect for so
19:23
yeah um no comments on the specific applicants but I just in general
19:29
um want to thank all of these people for wanting to continue in service um the
19:34
zoning and planning board are really important it's um very detailed work and
19:40
the the time and effort that these boards put into it um is very much appreciated so I'm I'm very glad to see
19:46
these people want to continue on and and you know Leverage The expertise they've gained going forward and uh appreciate
19:53
everybody who serves on our boards yeah the these are the the core kind of um
19:59
statutory required boards actually the board of assessment review is the third one and getting those in place is
20:06
important and I I'm totally with your comments on you know thanking them for their service so yeah I was I haven't
20:12
had the opportunity yet to interact with montos but both with stow and Elaine just really appreciate again that
20:17
thoughtfulness and they take this role very seriously and are thinking about what fits within the overall structure
20:23
of Beacon and how and within the laws that exist in New York state and locally when they think about any any request
20:29
that comes before them so I really appreciate them in that regard okay absolutely so the I said the third
20:36
statutory board is the board of assessment review and there is one renewal there that's Bob polii and Bob
20:42
also has done this for quite some time I don't know who appointed Bob it might have been Randy it might have been
20:48
before that but he's been doing it for some time and if you recall the board of assessment review has a role um during
20:56
the um uh assessment the grievance grievance
21:02
process thank you right uh and so they will hear uh when citizens come in and
21:08
you know we as a full value assessing Community every year we send a letter to
21:13
every property owner saying here's the change in your assessment and so only full value communities do that about
21:20
more than half of the communities in dutes are full value communities but not all of them but we end up with what what
21:26
we think is the much more equitable and even you know evenhanded roles as a
21:32
result the re the review process is an opportunity for people to uh you know
21:37
question their individual assessments and I think that process works pretty
21:42
well and in the end we have extremely very very few uh actual grievances that go to court
21:50
right so anything on on Bob um I noticed that his was a little
21:55
bit retroactive so we kind of catching up I think his started October November I mean I think a couple years ago we had
22:01
ones that were even more retroactive so I appreciate catching up on these where we can yeah we got a notice from
22:08
Secretary of State or who does notices on board of assessment oh it was the real property real property at the
22:13
county level correct and that noted us to oops we're off on one and so we yeah we're just catching up on that one and
22:20
are all the board of assessment terms it looks like five years five years by state law okay yeah and I think they
22:26
stagger a year at a time correct yeah okay thank you thank you and then the next two are tree advisory committee so
22:32
the this is an ad hoc committee um but we have you know a couple of people who have served um Pete Bailey actually has
22:39
an expertise and Andy Bell has always you know been involved in environmental things and serves on this board as well
22:45
as the greenway committee so I'd like to reappoint them as well and I'll just put
22:51
a plugin for my favorite City Holiday Arbor Day which this group also does I
22:58
really love that one um so and they always do a very nice job with it so sorry Andy's on the greenway committee
23:05
not on the CAC that I think that's right yes okay and but there is the tree
23:12
advisory committee is required to have a CAC member on it is that not correct a
23:17
is that um I can check uh Ben might know the answer to that question I'm not
23:24
sure we can we'll check okay not hand but all
23:29
um was that a yes you'll check bin yes okay that's what he yep I'll check into that I just don't recall off hand it it
23:36
does appear that way one member shall be from the conservation advisory committee and one member shall be in arborus so
23:42
that sounds like um Pete Bailey yeah um but it is in the code that one uh should
23:48
be from the cic um I actually I don't believe Pete is an arborist but there is another member who is an arborist okay
23:54
whose name is escaping me at the moment okay all right uh I have a process
24:03
question for you Nick when it comes to the voting half of this meeting are we able to bundle resolutions 2 through
24:09
nine the appointments or do we need to vote on them all separately no your rules don't um require may be voted on
24:15
separately that's at your call if you wish to vote individually vote on them by groups or do it as a bundle I would a
24:22
consent agenda for those items okay thank you Cent agenda that's the name for it thank you
24:29
and then I guess we'll follow up and just make sure we have somebody who's a CAC member also on the tree committee
24:34
okay yeah I'm meeting with the CAC chair next week and so we we'll talk our way through those issues great
24:40
okay um so the next one is the appointment of a real estate broker for our RFP and our two firehouses uh Nick
24:48
you're going to cover that I am mayor thank you so This concerns the RFP that the city issued on December 2nd for real
24:55
estate broker services for the sale of the property of 425 Main Street MA hoken
25:00
ladder building and 57 East Main Street the beacon engine building uh our office prepared the RFP in consultation with
25:07
City staff it was issued to through the traditional um way that the city issues
25:13
its rfps and bids it was additionally sent to local real estate brokers as
25:18
well as to the um real estate brokers Association Hudson Valley Gateway real
25:24
estate brokers Association so it was widely distributed um the RFP if you had
25:29
a chance to look at it was fairly comprehensive in terms of the description of the properties as well as the process as well as the submission
25:36
requirements a site visit was held of the two buildings on December 11th
25:41
attended by the mayor and myself and about 10 real estate brokers we spent probably a good 30 to 40 minutes in each
25:48
um building walked through the various floors gave the Brokers the um ability
25:53
to ask some basic questions we also required that any questions be submitted
25:59
in advance with respect to a process we received one or two and we did Issue an addendum um explaining some of the basic
26:05
procedural questions that had been asked if you've had a chance to look at the RFP proposal it provided a scope of work
26:14
it went into a brief description of the properties and then set forth um when
26:20
the proposal was due as well as what was required from each of the applicants a cover letter background information
26:26
experience summary so we knew what their qualifications were how they would Market the properties any additional
26:33
services and then the fee schedule that they were proposing some references statement that they had no conflict of
26:39
interest and their standard contract and also um submitting proof of their real estate brokerage license we then set
26:46
forth what the minimum qualifications were um to to be able to submit for the
26:52
um the bid that they be a licensed real estate broker they attend the site visit 5 years of experience in the Hudson
26:57
Valley And Timely submission and a complete submission there was then a selection process where we went through with
27:04
evaluations and criterias and then we noted some conditions of the properties
27:09
as well as in section 12 attached about 10 different documents we wanted real estate brokers to have as much
27:15
information as possible so we could receive good quality um proposals of the 10 who appeared four proposals were
27:23
submitted um one of which was for an auction process there was an auction
27:29
house that has shown experience auctioning properties in the past we did not feel that was appropriate for the
27:35
city's goals if you auction it off you don't necessarily have the opportunity to negotiate and perhaps get the best
27:40
value you also don't determine the end user you've been selling it to the highest bidder we didn't believe that
27:47
was in the city's interest based on our experience in the INR sales of single family homes when the city has acquired
27:53
properties we've determined that the going through a real estate broker really allowed the city to have more
27:58
control of the process and the end use put terms and conditions on the sale of the property and have a discussion with
28:05
the purchaser so an auction house was not appropriate so we removed that one from consideration the other three were
28:12
all um well qualified had relevant experience connections with uh marketing
28:17
commercial properties in the city it was Coldwell Banker uh Mr Aubrey which is here in Beacon um Compass realy through
28:24
Gate House Charlotte gery and then McGrath realy from Fishkill all of them submitted good quality proposals that we
28:32
reviewed ultimately we determined that the proposal from Gate House realy Compass was the one that seemed best
28:38
suited again good competitive process um but we felt like Gate House realy in terms of its evaluation of the
28:45
property's proposed offering price their commission was competitive as well as
28:50
the uh prior sales that they had satisfied us that um it was a good call between the three of them but Gate House
28:56
was one that stood out to us so the process from here would be if the council selects it we would um finalize
29:04
the contract meet with a real estate broker to identify the best way to market the properties if there's anything that needs to be done to clean
29:10
them out and then agree upon the uh sales price and then have them start
29:16
listing it and schedule open houses and do their
29:21
marketing um thank you Nick uh the only thing I would add as Nick um uh described my only role in the process
29:28
which was I did go to the site visit yes and otherwise I you not correct
29:35
okay and Nick the uh the RFP remained as it was initially issued there was no changes to it subsequent to the initial
29:41
issue of it correct there were some uh one or two questions they were all substantive there was no modification
29:48
issued to the RFP itself we had had some conversation about including a lease option to explore for one of the
29:54
properties but that was not included so that was not responded to by any of the any of the proposers there was one
30:00
proposer who did suggest that was a possibility and put forth why they felt that was necessary and also doesn't mean
30:06
we're precluded from doing that if the council decides during our discussions whether that's an option and that's a discussion we can have an executive
30:13
session either of the any of the three individuals had the ability to Market it either as a for sale or for
30:19
lease and Nick you're saying we should have that conversation in executive session yes that would be an appropriate
30:26
one for real property we do have an executive s session scheduled after the second of tonight's meetings very good for that topic
30:32
yes I think just to um clarify and just kind of state this for the public as well um there's a a couple of concerns I
30:41
think that we've heard but I'm looking at the special conditions on um I think page 49 of our agenda um that that
30:49
states that both properties have some restrictive covenants especially around removing altering or defacing historical
30:56
architectural features um and that both properties are in the city's historic overlay District so any alterations
31:02
would be subject to that code so that was part of the RFP and will be known and then the other thing I wanted to
31:07
clarify was that um and again we've we've talked about this at meetings but I just want to reiterate um the parking
31:15
that's behind the firehouse on Main Street is not part of the RFP right that's owned by the city and the city at
31:22
this point is planning to maintain that parking so um any of the uh real estate
31:28
activities around are really just for the building and do not include the parking lot right that is correct so we
31:35
are working with John Rus of a city's engineer to create a new plot a new land description for this property and as
31:42
presently drawn it does not include the parking lot the parking lot would be kept as a public parking lot okay thank
31:48
you and you're correct that yes we part of the advantage of going through the um
31:54
brokerage process is we can have negotiations and disc discussions with the prospective purchaser especially as
32:00
to terms and conditions regarding the exterior of the building and and its uses and the building is subject to the
32:06
uh historic overlay District as you indicated thank you um I think I I'm
32:12
going to start with a kind of broad question I have um Nick could you talk us through a in a little more detail
32:19
what um the process looks like from here we talked about um there being potential
32:25
for Council to have an executive session conversation about um potential different forms of um
32:33
what we're looking for in terms of entertaining the idea of a lease option
32:39
um but what are going the going to be the overall upcoming opportunities for
32:45
um Council to give feedback on this process um when does a decision actually
32:51
get made about a sale or not um and what is that process going to look like for
32:57
the public as well um I know some of this process has necessarily happened in executive session um and I want the
33:04
public to be aware of why that is and what pieces of the process um need to be
33:09
happening where certainly and one of the things to keep in mind also and a reason why a lot of this is not um done in the
33:16
public is the city has a fiduciary duty to its taxpayers to maximize the value of a properties not do anything that
33:22
would be negatively impact that so we're not going to negotiate in public so if we get a an offer for the property
33:29
that's going to be discussed in an executive session and appropriate to do so so the process is once you uh select
33:37
the broker staff will work with that broker in terms of a marketing plan we also have the executive session you'll
33:43
give us your thoughts and views on that once it's marketed we will bring back any offers to the council you will have
33:49
provided us feedback Serv as to what your um thoughts are on the intended use
33:55
while listen to what those intended uses are we'll bring back to you what the various offers are we'll discuss those
34:00
in the executive session you'll give us guidance and we'll shape the discussion based upon what the uh majority of the
34:07
council directs us to do with respect to entertaining offers before a contract is prepared
34:15
we'll come to you with the final offer discuss any terms and conditions we would propose and then get your
34:21
conceptual approval of that we'll then draft the contract have it negotiated with the attorneys have it signed signed
34:28
by the um purchaser and then bring it to you for your review and approval we'll likely keep you informed as to that
34:34
process and generally the contract does not become public until after it is
34:39
approved by the council the reason being if the council doesn't approve the contract you've then disclosed financial
34:46
terms other terms that may be disadvantaged to reveal if you were selling your own house you wouldn't
34:52
disclose these things and nor should the council do so either so that's the General process and
34:58
how we would keep the council involved and we'll give you periodic updates as well and then so what within that
35:05
process are our opportunities for public feedback in each of those stages if
35:13
any none required it's all within the council you're the elected bodies so there's no other them through public
35:20
comment periods where people can express opinions other than that it's the seven of you who are vested with deciding
35:25
what's in the best interest of the city so there's no role but the opportunities are there during public
35:31
comment but what information will the public have access to to be able to
35:37
comment on Just for public information that when it gets listed they would have access to
35:43
review the listing that is publicly available in terms of offers and prices
35:48
and future uses they wouldn't
35:54
okay and we wouldn't have the uh I
36:02
guess would would we be allowed to hypothetically um make those offers or
36:08
parts of those offers public or is that inadvisable or is that
36:15
illegal hypothetically you could do it I think you're putting a chilling effect
36:20
on purchasers who are going to then go through a a public process so I think it's inadvisable okay because who are
36:28
they negotiating with you are the seven who are elected you will represent the city and you have
36:33
a real estate broker and staff um but there's nothing illegal about it to answer your question I but I do not
36:39
think it's going to result in the best product because it's not going to be it's going to slow the process down and
36:45
it's going to open it up to a lot of intangibles and invariables that I don't think will be
36:51
helpful okay do any other council members have
36:56
thoughts on this and and what sort of feedback other people are thinking they may want in making a decision in this
37:06
process well I mean I was listening to the questions and it's like the the
37:13
public input other than public comments where you get to choose you know any topic are focused around um either
37:22
resolutions or decisions of the council that require an ordinance or the approval of the budget
37:28
um is there a public hearing when we actually say this is the one we're selling there isn't there's no public
37:34
hearing yeah no okay so that says this is the one where you can get any input
37:40
you want but there's no formal uh involvement other than the electeds that are here correct it's similar to the
37:47
process we followed in the past whether we've sold single fames homes whether it's sold the Old Highway garage
37:53
so I wasn't on Council for those processes so um this is a little new to me sure um and and what I'm finding a
38:01
little bit difficult about this process is that because parts of it need to be an executive session um you know I don't
38:09
have the same latitude that I might in other decisions to just solit as much feedback as I'd like on um particular
38:17
decisions if some of the information is not yet public if you understand I do
38:22
and as we go through that process I can certainly have those conversations with you right
38:28
I think one thing and and Lee I appreciate you have already mentioned this multiple times I think perhaps
38:34
tonight and if not at other phases of this process however long it ends up taking is just to remind both the
38:41
council and the public about why selling these at all and not keeping them in the
38:46
city I think is relevant I can appreciate from The public's perspective particularly ma but really both of them
38:52
are very publicly located they seem like a great opportunity for the city to hold
38:57
on to them for a variety of different things and I think just understanding the benefit of selling them and what we
39:03
could get while also recognizing that it might mean that a currently city-owned space becomes
39:11
private yeah I mean you know on that subject right
39:16
again the critical thing for the building across the street was not its
39:21
design was it was finding out how to finance what we were trying to do and then being able to say okay we can also
39:28
Finance you know the the geothermal piece which one one of the last pieces we added and then the exterior you know
39:35
brick which was one of the last pieces we added and those decisions were based on here the assumptions we're making
39:41
about our building needs um you know and we can discuss in executive session
39:46
there was some conversations about using some of those buildings for other purposes which we'll go into I will say
39:53
that the public comment I've heard on the subject is you know people assume first of all that we could just give the
39:59
building to someone uh which we can't do that we could somehow lease the building for virtually no cost which we can't do
40:08
um and if we're leasing then we're going to have to go through all the renovations and we can talk about the
40:14
difference between a government and what we have to do with Renovations versus
40:19
what a private sector has to do we can discuss those in executive session but once you go through those components and
40:25
then you think what other assets do we have as a city that are physical buildings and I particularly am thinking
40:30
about West Center Street um you know I I think those are some of the issues and
40:35
again I think those are things we can all say in public without any problem uh any specifics beyond that I think I'd
40:43
reserve for the conversation in executive session so well I think the
40:48
other piece here and because I appreciate your question Molly um of
40:53
just playing this out in terms of why must we sell this building at all um
41:01
this is a you know a conversation that we've had an executive session but we haven't fully had in public nor there
41:07
piece of that conversation we shouldn't have in public um but I think the 101 that um Le you've you know expressed in
41:15
one way or another is that um we need the funds to pay for the firehouse that
41:22
part of the calculus of the new Firehouse um was with the that we would
41:28
be selling these two buildings is that accurate to say yeah I think we discussed that as Council too right so
41:35
what happens if we don't sell these buildings is that we need to find those funds another
41:40
way um is that correct if I could yeah we've always talked with the finance
41:46
director about how to afford this building and that was always part of the calculus of getting rid of the firehouse
41:53
when when we built the original topkins hose The Old Firehouse was transer to Community Development and then later
41:59
sold to the glass works that's worked out really well and that's what we're looking to do here if we don't sell
42:05
these buildings there's a cost to us not selling it and then there would be somewhere down the road a cost to
42:10
renovate that that would come out of other projects and we should be clear about that like we have millions of
42:17
dollars in improvements that need to be done in our Parks we have a lot of work
42:22
to be done on our road infrastructure our sidewalks other things if we're going to keep moving along on those um
42:29
and now we have to carry two buildings that were never anticipated other things are going to
42:35
have to be scaled back yeah so it's it's again about priorities yeah I think
42:40
you're making the point that I'm I'm asking to be to be made publicly I I think that we all want to understand or
42:48
I think the public needs to understand and I certainly want to understand um sort of what the implications are of the
42:55
full scope of options we have here but um the option of not selling for example has these Downstream right
43:02
consequences um and I think my other sort of question within that um was
43:09
something that you said Lee um about um that we cannot for example give it away
43:18
right um Nick can you say more about that correct so you have again this fiary dut obligation to act out in the
43:24
best interest of the taxpayers is being determined at doesn't have public use you're not using it for the fire
43:30
purposes that's what it's designed for um it would be cost money to renovate it
43:35
for a different use and bring it up to up to current standards um
43:40
and the um in terms of gifting it away or giving it to use that's less of
43:46
market value the New York state constitution would consider that to be a gift of public fund so municipalities
43:52
have this fiduciary duty and obligation to make sure that public tax dollars as well as assets are used for public
43:58
purposes and in this case if you were to lease it to someone for a dollar to a religious organization as one example
44:05
that would be impermissible because you need to get fair market value so if you're going to lease it you'd have to get fair market value likewise if you're
44:12
going to sell to someone you have to get it for a fair market value and there's some factors you can take into
44:17
consideration that we'll discuss in executive session that allow you to consider different prices and different
44:23
offers right so um just I'm I'm asking these sort of basic questions um to help
44:31
hopefully other people understand as well as myself um but um for example um
44:39
selling it to a not for-profit which is by definition a public entity though
44:44
it's not a municipal public entity is not a sort of loophole to that and can
44:49
you explain why that might be correct if you're going to sell to a not for profit you'd have to sell for fair market value
44:56
or otherwise Justus ify why you're not selling it for fair market value again you have to explain to the taxpayer why
45:01
am I selling it for X when I could get y for it is there a justification I think you'd find it difficult to come up with
45:08
it I'm not going to say you can't but I think it'd be difficult to do so yeah and we had the same issue when the city
45:13
purchased the parking lot across the street which was purchased from the Tomkins hose volunteer company and it
45:20
was arms length at what we thought was market value right and that's what we had to do right they were very happy
45:26
with that yes so and so trying to keep this generic still and tell me if we're approaching
45:32
into executive session conversations but is there not an option or has there been an analysis or could there be an
45:38
analysis where there could be a lease Arrangement where the where we'd have option of still using the property much
45:43
further down the line but there could be a less a leaser someone to lease the property where it could be um
45:49
advantageous from a revenue perspective and coupled with that I know we've had conversations around um the renovation
45:56
requirement um is there not is there something different for a city-owned property that
46:02
would go into lease where we would not be responsible for the renovations where we might find someone who wants to lease
46:07
it under a tripl net lease Arrangement where they would take responsibility for all Renovations so better discuss an
46:14
executive session yeah no but I I think this is a good
46:21
conversation because we're we're trying to get information into the public on it that we can get out there yeah and I I
46:28
would I would expect throughout this process we will probably have variations of this conversation multiple times just
46:34
as we go through this and it is a very public uh piece of property and means a lot for different people for different
46:40
reasons and so I think the the even if for us it might feel like we're going over the same stuff I think for the benefit of the public I would appreciate
46:46
us continuing to have it sorry Nick I interrupted you go ahead no no no I'm good um just to go to clarify the
46:53
selection of the broker in that case is it similar to when we pick a contractor
46:59
that we don't have to have the highest bidder the person who is guaranteed to
47:04
either give us the best rate or get the highest price is that kind of true correct so this is for the equivalent of
47:10
Professional Services so it's not contract work it's not having Firehouse built it's not the road being paav where
47:16
you're going out for public bidding this is an RFP process where you can take into account the um the price the value
47:24
the skill level of the individuals great thank you you're welcome yeah the other thing and I thought about it I I'm
47:30
pretty sure I can say this um the last Firehouse proposal before I became mayor
47:37
and I think I've mentioned this Council was stay at ma um buy The Old City Hall
47:43
structure next door tear it down uh tear down the back half of the memorial
47:50
building build an extension to maze behind there and parking behind there
47:55
and and I looked at that and said you you're picking the most expensive real estate in the city that's to our
48:01
advantage for me to say that um where we can get the most value and you want to
48:06
take tear them down and then build and this is just I just decided it was nonsense and once we had purchased the
48:13
parking lot across from topkins hose and it was ours that piece of the puzzle was done and then we could focus on can we
48:20
make topkins work uh and that's how it turned out so I mean that's some of the considerations it's it's right on Main
48:27
Street it's expensive real estate and even if we were to ever consider leasing it out we'd have to lease it out at
48:33
market and I I I don't think that's serving us at all but we can you know discuss that further in terms of the
48:40
details so and and I would just say for the Public's edification that we did an
48:46
analysis of whether it had use for public uses so many of you know we're
48:52
constrained physically on Space here in this building we did in valuation with the architect that building really
48:59
doesn't fit our needs or we would have taken it for a new city hall and we we talk to them rather it would be much
49:04
more effective and efficient for us to do um some kind of buildout on the back
49:10
of the building here um because the number of offices that we need just in warrant you know the heavy Capital
49:17
Investments to get that building to what it would need to be for municipal purposes so we did we did consider that
49:25
though yeah and now that clar L has passed um
49:30
this isn't my favorite building um but um you know the way Chris described it
49:36
is where we the conclusion that both of us reached which is our space needs that are administrative are probably most
49:44
effectively done by some small Edition here or some some some changes here
49:49
however minor I do keep thinking I'm going to go across the street and get an office and give up my what's also
49:55
doubling as a conference room because I get kicked out of the mayor's office when there's a conference meeting um
50:01
which I think is just fine personally but anyway so I'm guessing the geothermal HVAC is really excellent over
50:07
there as a we encouraging to go over there more um I did have a another sort of
50:16
technical question um to go back into some of the the details of the RFP um I
50:23
found the conflict of interest statement description not super specific but maybe that's also just my lack of experience
50:30
here um could you could someone give me an example of what kind of conflict of
50:37
interest might qualify or what would conflict sorry what would qualify as a conflict of
50:44
interest well one comes immediately if we had a staff member who was a real
50:50
estate broker okay right we wouldn't want that right or married to someone who
50:57
zombie Council who or something of that nature right so had person con nepotism
51:04
anything that would I mean when you do these you have to have a real um sense that that you awarded it
51:13
based on Merit alone yeah and not who you knew or connections yeah I think
51:20
those personal conflicts of interest um certainly do make sense to me I think I was trying to play out for myself if
51:27
there would be a business conflict of interest between the entity Compass um
51:32
and a a different real estate deal that they were doing that somehow conflicted with this one or yeah a business
51:38
conflict well would be one if they themselves had a development project
51:43
before the planning board or if they had litigation against the the uh the city
51:49
for some reason um so if your Law Firm wanted to buy the building yes okay
51:55
we'll talk separately about that okay but but Realtors also have um code of ethics that they have to abide by and
52:02
they have to disclose certain conflicts of interest so like if they were trying to
52:08
drive the price down so they could use it for their new building that would clearly be a conflict good example um
52:14
and we didn't we didn't see a conflict with any of the any of the any of the four proposals yeah
52:22
um okay okay and and again we do have something
52:30
uh scheduled at the end of the council meeting as well on real estate topic okay um so the next one is the
52:38
Beacon Street uh tip Transportation Improvement program grant funding authorization U Chris you will tell us
52:45
what you're asking us to authorize you to do yes um I'll give a little bit of background um the transportation
52:52
Improvement project is the transportation Improvement program is a
52:57
capital program that's administered by The Duchess County transportation Council in the county uh these federal
53:03
dollars come come through their agency and then are awarded for bridge and road
53:09
projects on federal aid eligible roads and bridges um they have not done a call
53:15
for projects in some number of years because there was there were more projects than money and for the first
53:21
time in several years they've issued a call for projects 6 7 million for local
53:27
Bridges and 9.8 million for federal aid roads
53:33
um the tip program is basically um an investment of 80% Federal funding with a
53:40
20% local match it's a lot like we did on the Main Street bump outs years ago
53:45
although that was augmented with another funding source um we had previously done
53:52
a study of beakman Street to make it a complete street with a bike Lane um uh
53:58
sidewalk extensions and repair the road um that was done in 2018 by the same
54:04
agency DCTC and Ben has uploaded that to your packet um I spoke to the director
54:11
of DCTC back in December when they issued this he confirmed and I looked on the
54:16
maps and it is a federal aid eligible Road um and they would look very highly upon a project that built upon a prior
54:24
Transportation study that hadn't been implemented one of the reasons I think it hadn't been implemented is we had a
54:30
long-term parking agreement with Metro North that would have precluded the bike
54:36
Lanes from being put in um and that agreement is up in 2027 so this would be
54:41
a multi-year process that we would just be starting um the we we attended the
54:47
workshop in mid December which was a requirement um we're getting the application together and that requires
54:54
this uh resolution that we've put before you and then the announcements would be
54:59
made somewhere around June and after June the process would be um it it's
55:05
about a 3 to four year process depending on whether and how much right away you have to acquire so you do conceptual
55:12
design then you get public comment and you choose one scenario to go with then you do preliminary and design and you
55:19
get further feedback and then you do a final design along the way you also do your RightWay investigations to make
55:25
sure you own the real estate necessary for that and if you don't you acquire it and that's what held up Fishkill teller
55:32
for so many years we had three dozen little pieces of land that had to be acquired once all that is done and
55:38
certified and reviewed by dot then you can move into construction so the earliest this would ever come to
55:45
construction is well after the agreement with Metro north um expires in 2027 it's
55:52
we probably wouldn't touch the construction on this till at least 2028 um so we we'd like to line it up it's
55:59
it's a great project from dcc's point of view and our point of view because it's linking Main Street with Transit with
56:06
the uh train station and with the ferry um it's a half mile so it's a doable
56:12
small project um and some of you will remember we delayed repaving beakman
56:17
street because we didn't want to preclude doing this and this call for projects basically speeds up our
56:24
timeline of possibly implementing this so it could include installation of bike
56:30
Lanes installation of new sidewalk Rehabilitation of existing sidewalk new
56:35
drainage structures as well as um new um surfacing and and striping sidewalk and
56:43
curb ramps um and crosswalks so um it
56:48
also Builds on a study I think we're really poised to get this because Metro North about two years ago did a Last
56:55
Mile study of how to get people from the train station to um to Main Street and
57:00
other locations and this figured prominently in that um so one of the
57:06
requirements is to have this authorization from the board um it doesn't guarantee we do it but we'll
57:12
take that next step forward and get this in by the grant deadline on January 24th
57:17
and we have asked the engineer the city engineer to start working up possible numbers for what this would cost we we
57:25
wouldn't know until we determine the final design so we'll um you know do a worst case scenario so that we can come
57:31
down off the number rather than try to find more funding um but we we think this would be um a great way to get that
57:39
roadway um improved on someone else's nickel well mostly again it's a four to
57:46
one match it's four four Federal to one local yeah can you say a bit more about
57:53
what parts this grant would fund is it the full through construction or it's the entire thing so it this is
58:00
essentially what we're doing with teller Fishkill teller Avenue um in that case
58:05
we also had State funding that helped with the local match so on Fishkill
58:11
teller it's um 80% Federal 15% State
58:16
Transportation money and then 5% local and that 5% we can get back through um
58:22
programmatic money that we get for State touring rout so it's essentially 100 % paid for and it'll do the same scope of
58:29
work drainage uh roadway sidewalks bike Lanes crosswalks Ada curb L ramps um and
58:37
they'll do every phase of the project they will pay for engineering investigations for rways acquisition of
58:44
Rightway Construction and construction inspection so there's a real there's a
58:49
real formula to all of this it's not fast it's um often you know somewhat
58:56
bureaucratic but it is a good way of bringing in quite a bit of outside money to get a project done and then if we
59:03
were granted the tip at that point we sound like we have some time or we could see if we were able to get similar State
59:09
matches or other other funding it's not necessarily have to all come out of for instance there was another funding
59:15
source called CRP carbon Reduction Program money that we augmented the Main
59:21
Street Access Project with um we still have a little bit of that money left over I'm trying to roll that into um
59:29
into Fishkill teller Avenue to extend sidewalks um we might be able to get
59:34
something like that to augment our local share but again it's not a huge huge
59:40
number we're talking about a half a mile um I I don't have cost estimates yet but
59:45
our share would be in the hundreds of thousands not in the millions
59:51
so um and and even with that just so I understand those funds would be in a
59:59
2027 budget a 2028 budget it it really depends on whether we need RightWay okay
1:00:05
the the rightaway process slows this down a lot because you have to you have to do the deed research you have to
1:00:11
figure out what you don't own and then once you know what you don't own you have to map it you have to Value it you
1:00:18
have to make offers to the owners that that process can sometimes take a year
1:00:23
in fact that that held up fish gu teller for many years and um and then if you
1:00:29
don't have a willing seller then you sometimes will use eminent domain to take those properties now here we don't
1:00:35
have a lot of property owners we might be able to contain it within the
1:00:40
existing Highway boundary of the road so my My Hope Is as we do it there there's
1:00:46
minimal or no right away um but we we do need to be prepared for that contingency that it might take
1:00:53
a little time to acquire properties right yeah my recollection is you know we've
1:00:59
had development proposals along West Maine area we had one situation where
1:01:05
there was a little bit of property in under the sidewalk but generally this is an urban renewal stretch and I'm I'm
1:01:12
kind of hoping it's it'll be pretty clean whereas you know Fishkill and Teller they're all pre-existing
1:01:19
properties built right up against them so I'm hoping this is going to be easier
1:01:24
you can also revise your design scenario in reaction to whether or not you own right away
1:01:32
like you if if you know you're going to be held up by a year or two just on on a
1:01:37
few properties and you can avoid those properties by doing a design change that's something that the consultant
1:01:44
engineer would do so none of this would be done by the City attorney He he'll do the initial cost estimates but under the
1:01:51
dot process we'd have to put this out to um a list called the ldsa which are the
1:01:57
qualified firms that do Transportation projects federal aid projects um we choose them based on their Merit uh we'd
1:02:04
get into contract with them and go through each phase and at each phase you would authorize the funding for that so
1:02:12
there there will be if we do this there will be a lot of votes to come just like there were on fish teller um and this is
1:02:19
just the first step forward yeah and I would also wouldn't be surprised and
1:02:25
maybe get your thoughts and Nick's thoughts too about sounds like depending on what's discovered with e Menon right
1:02:30
away there might be some executive sessions where we're shared with this as some of the things we're facing and some of the decisions that might be coming
1:02:37
our way even if the actual discussion of that is in public yes
1:02:43
okay um I have a few questions um knowing that the complete
1:02:49
streets proposal was completed in 2018 um and also considering that we may
1:02:57
have a major um new development at the train station um does the design need to
1:03:05
be reviewed for um new traffic patterns or any other potential updates yeah it
1:03:12
would be so under the preliminary design they're not going to that that's dated
1:03:18
it but it it gave a basis for moving forward it was clear that you know there
1:03:23
was some public comment at that time about it there was a report it had some existing conditions so you can think of
1:03:30
that as a as a baseline but we have to update that Baseline so they'll look at traffic they'll look at anticipated
1:03:37
impacts from the to if that goes forward um they'll have to consider other work that we've done um you know again we we
1:03:47
everything will be looked at by The Firm that comes on in terms of traffic volumes turning radiuses pedestrian
1:03:54
safety bicycle safety okay great
1:04:01
um what was my oh my other main question I think you basically answered with some
1:04:06
context was um if this might be a recurring opportunity or if this is a um
1:04:14
and in which case could we be thinking about you know as a council other projects that we might want to
1:04:21
prioritize but I think what you said is that it's recurring but infrequent
1:04:26
okay okay yes and in fact I don't think I'm really glad they waited to do this
1:04:32
now because I don't think we would have been poised to apply for this um more
1:04:40
like if they did it two years ago they would have said look you have $9 million for Fishkill teller Avenue that you've
1:04:45
never used now we've clearly used it we're showing the transportation Council that that we're effective in managing
1:04:52
these projects that project will be done by July so um I think we're really well
1:04:57
poised I don't know when the next one would come out they're they're really intermittent and some I think the last
1:05:04
one was more than five years ago okay there may be other Grant sources coming out like the tap Grant the
1:05:10
transportation alternative program and that was one I was going to look at for this as
1:05:16
well okay I'm just thinking I mean this is
1:05:22
getting off subject but is what you're discussing is that that's something with Fishkill Avenue that can be considered
1:05:30
um for better alternative transportation there well I I think I don't think that
1:05:38
that would be ready for this round because we haven't even finished the Baseline project but yes it could be
1:05:43
eligible it's also on the federal aid list okay yeah yeah but you're you're hearing out
1:05:50
loud some of the conversations that we have in terms of trying to figure out you know what can we do how do we get
1:05:56
funding you know how do we Tee It Up in word order um and a lot of it has to do
1:06:02
with you know can we get funding right because it it makes a huge difference for us
1:06:09
so okay good discussion okay um the last item is uh
1:06:16
designating the pipsy journal as the newspaper of record uh not with standing our friend Jeff uh who's here um it's a
1:06:23
requirement that Jeff we tried they the attorneys will not let us year I I make
1:06:28
a run at it every year though and there are statutory reasons why I like Jeff
1:06:35
to do you want to remind the public of those statutory yeah you better tell them now that we've yes so it needs to
1:06:42
be in general paid public circulation and it doesn't meet that criteria I think for one or two others we've had
1:06:47
these have had these discussions in the past it's not just u in this municipality it's in a number of municipalities with local newspapers and
1:06:54
it would be nice to a state law change but that's not occurring and you don't have that authority to change
1:06:59
it then you need to designate an official newspaper pursuant to state law so this also pertains to the beacon Free
1:07:06
Press we couldn't do that either right even though we know both of those papers give much better coverage of our local
1:07:13
um issues than the pyy journal they do um and and whenever there is a public
1:07:20
notice to be made um it is sent to both the pipy journal and um the other these
1:07:28
other outlets so they can notice if they can is that correct no no Public Notices are paid and they are a a formula that
1:07:35
you have to do like for a public hearing so we only send those to the pipsy journal because they cost money
1:07:44
okay but usually we we get good coverage from both papers about those things and
1:07:50
the pipy journal you know puts an ad that's way back in the paper so and this
1:07:55
City provides also the ability for its residents to sign up for a list serice so they get notification of the agendas
1:08:00
and uh items that will be on zoning and planning board meetings that I think my opinion is more effective than the legal
1:08:06
Publications yeah this is something that really hasn't kept out with the change of local media I mean this is something
1:08:14
from when there were actual newspapers other you know the daily newspapers that
1:08:19
everybody got a paper copy of
1:08:27
okay motion to adure so I had two things if that's okay um one um I was reminded
1:08:35
of two things from earlier items one is um it would be if it would be possible
1:08:42
um to get an update on any pending vacancies on any of our committees um I know that we've sort of
1:08:49
checked in on this um maybe once a year um but knowing that you know we're about
1:08:55
to do a slate of renewals um I feel like this
1:09:00
an opportunity to do a general plug for all of our committees um in addition to
1:09:05
um the thanks that has already been shared for all of these hardworking volunteers
1:09:12
okay um and I also want to note that I'm I'm concerned I was a little too
1:09:18
dismissive of the idea of an alternative process for seeking um Council approval
1:09:25
for for an alternative appointment um and so if there is a specific proposal
1:09:31
for an alternative process while we are still in Workshop I would like to hear it though at this moment um without a
1:09:39
specific proposal I am still prepared to vote and and so that would be a proposal
1:09:44
consistent with the city Charter though right yeah right so there isn't an alternative process because the charter
1:09:50
sets forth what the process is and that it is the mayor's recommendation the mayor makes the appointment and U the
1:09:58
mayor announc what his process was so that was varying a little bit and I did have a conversation with the mayor that
1:10:03
I was concerned that he's going outside the charter and setting a precedent that would be used upon future Mayors and the
1:10:10
mayor can't do that the mayor has to think of the office of the mayor and live within the bounds of the charter so
1:10:16
there's not an alternate um provision that can be considered by this Council
1:10:21
of been changing the charter right so the mayor can't change change his process in terms of um the
1:10:29
appointment but the council could have our own process in terms of giving our consent correct you have to so your rol
1:10:38
is to be comfortable your do you agree with the Mayor's Choice and you can ask whatever questions or make any inquiries
1:10:44
or determine what that process is so you can evaluate the individual who's being presented to you what you can't do is
1:10:51
suggest to the mayor who the office of the mayor should consider what process they should
1:10:57
follow and we were getting close to that and that's the conversation I had with the mayor yeah I
1:11:03
see uh is there another process that the rest of council would want to
1:11:12
entertain if not I'm happy to let this go for example you it's it's a two-year
1:11:17
term and typically it doesn't you know it's it's a very short
1:11:24
time and even as we speak within two months
1:11:30
people who choose to run for city council can be working on that and
1:11:36
getting petitions right now yeah well I mean petition process hasn't opened but
1:11:41
it's like signatures will be started so my feeling is it is important to have it
1:11:48
is wonderful to have someone experienced who it's kind of like a plug andplay and
1:11:53
so we can move forward with our business business because you know within less than a year you're going to have new
1:12:00
Council people you know so possibly I mean that's just my opinion I I am fine
1:12:06
with how it is just a point of clarification this appointment is for a one-year term yeah expiring in December
1:12:12
of 2025 because it's fulfilling the balance of the remaining two-year term right right like everybody will be
1:12:18
running for reelection again so so if someone feels they you know they didn't
1:12:24
get this position they have an opportunity to work towards that position yes in less than a few months
1:12:32
towards that and the problem is that there's a a power to the default and so
1:12:38
someone who's appointed and at the time of reelection or election they have I think a leg up based on experience and
1:12:44
observation that people going through the process may not have so it's just um
1:12:50
you know it's one of the concerns I have about the singular voice in choosing who that replacement is you know I'm I'm
1:12:55
interested in the charter revision where there would be a process where there would be review by the entire Council
1:13:01
not just of the selection made but of the of the candidates that were that were interested in the position I think
1:13:06
that would encourage more people to to voice their interest in the position and it seems like it's not an infrequent
1:13:12
occurrence based on recent observations and Nick what would be the
1:13:17
process for a charter change like that that would be subject to a
1:13:23
mandatory referendum because you're diluting the power of the mayor so you would draft a local
1:13:29
law Workshop it set it down for a public hearing receive comments then vote upon
1:13:35
that and then it will be placed on a ballot for the public within a i foret
1:13:40
the exact maybe 90 days of the law being adopted it would have to be voted on by the uh electorate at either a special
1:13:46
election or if you timed it at the general election I mean I think your issue is that people haven't been
1:13:52
interested in running you've had two success of elections in which there was no Challenge and no primary um you know
1:14:01
again that George is willing to come back is is really helpful to the board
1:14:07
because and he is the only one of the applicants who's run for election recently and won um you know
1:14:15
again I I would just say it's kind of a if somebody else wants to run they they
1:14:22
can petition in March when you guys do
1:14:27
this but it helps to have a full Council too because we're going to have votes where people aren't here and then we're
1:14:34
not going to be able to do business because we don't have a
1:14:41
quorum okay yeah and I'm Cur we we happen to have had two of
1:14:48
these two years running and I I'm just curious in terms of the whether it's
1:14:53
worth the juice is worth the squeeze of going through a charter revision how often
1:14:59
this has happened in the past 20 years or so I just kind of want to clarify I I
1:15:04
appreciate it is a big deal who represents people and so it's maybe maybe the number of times it's happened is not as relevant for everyone but it
1:15:11
is something that I think about too so I don't know if if anyone has any knowledge about that or if that's if if
1:15:17
that's going to involve bunch of research I don't think it's worth it but that's sort of when I think about the long-term ramifications of this of all
1:15:24
the things for our limited time to focus on is this the one I want to focus on so I I got a long set of years on this one
1:15:32
the only one I can come up with is some guy who was appointed by Elliot Spitzer
1:15:39
to run a state agency and he resigned in
1:15:44
September and there was a ballot election in November and the council left the seat open until the end of the
1:15:51
year uh that's what I recall and in terms of just how many times a need to fill a vacancy has occurred I mean since
1:15:59
I have been on and Pam you predate me a little bit Yeah I'd say in the last 10
1:16:04
years it's been like the term for us in this one like this isn't something that
1:16:11
is happening constantly although I understand the the perception that yes
1:16:16
this occurred last year and it's occurring again I I don't recall one 30 years back other than the one I just
1:16:23
mentioned which was me yes I picked up one that I remember I think the the council member you know they were moving
1:16:31
to England actually like it it was a long time ago Oh you mean um Elizabeth
1:16:37
Foster yeah elz Foster I thought she served out her term did she serve out term I think so cuz I don't recall a
1:16:43
replacement okay but yeah she she just didn't run again I believe okay there's the timing worked out yeah I think
1:16:49
that's right she's back in town now too oh really yeah she moved back I also note May that section 10. to of a
1:16:55
charter requires a charter review that you appoint such commission every 10 years I don't think we're quite there
1:17:00
yet but I that will be upcoming probably in the next two to three years I can get you that exact
1:17:06
date that' be good to know and in terms of just to follow on your question Molly about is it worth the effort in essence
1:17:13
um if there was going to be more than one requested revision to the Charter
1:17:18
for example if there's something around how the agenda is set would that be a separate vote as well or could that be
1:17:24
couped together because that would also dilute the powers of the mayor I think if I'm right
1:17:30
that so I'd have to I'd have to get back to you on whether it's probably I don't know I'd get back to
1:17:36
you thank you yeah because it's how you frame a question is it on each specific provision or is it bundled
1:17:47
together the only comment I I would make is I have sat through almost all the
1:17:53
years of the new Charter right that came into place in uh
1:18:00
91 and I got on Council in 93 um and what I oftentimes tell people
1:18:07
is one of the reasons that Beacon has been so incredibly successful in you
1:18:13
know its Renaissance from its starting position as the poorest community in the county
1:18:19
um uh is the consistency of government and the this particular Charter and how
1:18:26
it was put together by the charter review commission they chose uh a strong
1:18:31
mayor system with a professional City administrator um different from pipy
1:18:36
right pipy the mayor doesn't meet with the council it's really strange so they
1:18:42
set up more of a completely separate executive and legislative branch and then Newberg you know the average tenure
1:18:49
of a city manager is 2 and a half years it might have lengthened to 3 years but there's this you know there in their
1:18:55
Charters were the makings of um lack of consistency whereas this is one where
1:19:02
it's worked really really well um and I'm just thinking I'm pleased it's
1:19:07
worked that well so that's those were the comments of Professor Benjamin from new if you remember who L the last
1:19:12
Charter commission that Beacon's Charter is unique in New York States in terms of
1:19:17
how it weighs the balance of power between the mayor having a strong mayor but not a mayor that is not kept in
1:19:24
checked by powers of the council mhm um I appreciate those those
1:19:32
Reflections um and I just want to make sure I understood Nick what you alluded to in terms of a charter Review
1:19:39
Committee um happening every 10 m years um I I would be curious to yeah have
1:19:47
those that information confirmed also knowing that our um comprehensive plan
1:19:52
is come do coming up as well um so understanding the phasing of what our two significant projects for the
1:19:59
city um would be really helpful
1:20:08
okay we all set now we went back to the uh one item but uh we were on item 12 I
1:20:16
think we finished that and are we okay to adjourn and take a motion to adjourn
1:20:22
second all in favor I I okay um do we need a two or three minute break nope
1:20:27
let's keep going said keep going we're
1:20:32
going the come on serious let's go all right come on there we go so let me call
1:20:40
the formal meeting to order uh let's do a pledge of allegiance the flag's behind
1:20:46
us I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the
1:20:52
Republic for which it stands one nation under God indivisible with liberty and
1:20:58
justice for all
1:21:06
okay um so in terms of roll call I see the same individuals uh I see uh Molly
1:21:14
Jeff Amber Paloma Pam and Lee I see the city administrator in person I see the
1:21:19
City attorney in person um and
1:21:25
and with that uh I'm going to do public comment
1:21:30
so if you have a public comment now's your time to make it I see one person on
1:21:36
this list uh it's hard to see I guess it's Teresa craft maybe so hey come on
1:21:47
up this year's going to be a good one I also want to note that there's only one person in the room other than you all so
1:21:54
come on down people Facebook's got nothing on it
1:21:59
um my New Year's resolution is to become more active in the city if that's possible I'll start
1:22:08
there and I'll say it again this municipality must establish an HD LPD
1:22:14
historic preservation commission and soon regarding the sale of the two firehouses the public will have
1:22:21
absolutely no say and input on the sale and will only have a say after the back
1:22:26
door deal is done it's another great potential for more smoke shops on Main Street the public should be able to
1:22:32
attend formal charettes and um presentations and tell the city what they want the buildings to become I've
1:22:39
said it before I'll say it again stop selling our history stop the overdevelopment and the cookie cutter
1:22:45
design flooding our main street please let the first quarter of 2025 be when
1:22:50
you enact a building moratorium a complete charart of revision and a new comprehensive plan let's remember George
1:22:57
retired from this Council years of watching him doodle at the table is nothing we want to witness again I am
1:23:03
not in favor of the mayor selection please stop playing the Partyline
1:23:10
politics there's a lot of people out there that want to do something and I just um happy New
1:23:17
Year thank you um I don't see anyone else in the physical public Ben anyone online want
1:23:24
to make a public comment you have one hand
1:23:31
mayor [Music]
1:23:43
Bening he might be having trouble with his mic again I know we just installed a new mic Ben we can't hear
1:23:52
you the tested did it earlier I know I did so um while we're waiting um without
1:24:01
closing the public comment period I will do a couple of announcements Ben has Ben is having one
1:24:08
new issues there is one person online who he'll connect okay if that happens we'll um listen to that comment and it's
1:24:15
mall so um let let me see if I can Ben if you
1:24:21
can give her permission can you unmute her okay Ma you're unmuted you have three
1:24:27
minutes hi everyone happy New Year um thank you to I'm sorry I'm
1:24:35
hearing some noise so I'll keep it short but um thank you to the council members
1:24:41
especially Paloma and Jeff that asked a lot of questions it's really helpful for
1:24:47
the public to get as much transparency as possible about what's happening I'm going to join Teresa in
1:24:55
the New Year's resolution um I also wanted
1:25:01
to um I forgot what oh yeah um speaking of
1:25:08
transparency um in February 2024 I sent the people that were on the council at
1:25:14
the time a list of uh three simple requests related to
1:25:20
transparency uh Ben was gracious enough to work on the search that didn't work on the
1:25:27
website to fix it with the vendor um it is not working again the other request
1:25:34
was to have more meaningful um minutes I stay again and again the
1:25:41
minutes and it's breaking my heart to hear the jokes like who is approving the
1:25:46
minutes the minutes are useless you have had several chances during the year to
1:25:52
look at previous minutes and use them for your decision making and I don't
1:25:58
understand why you want to deprive future councils and future residents and
1:26:04
just our future selves from that it's very important so I would really
1:26:10
appreciate it if in addition to all the great transparency efforts that some of you are doing um if you could handle
1:26:18
those issues as well and thank you everyone for your service and for your
1:26:23
work and congratulations to the retiree okay thank
1:26:30
you hello can you hear me now all right there's no further hands raised on Zoom okay thank you Ben um I
1:26:39
have a um one announcement to make so I'm going to designate so I'm supposed
1:26:44
to do this each year I need to designate uh two qualified individuals who can
1:26:49
serve in the capacity of City administrator uh in the event of extended abs since her vacancy and the
1:26:55
position and um I will uh designate the people that um the city administrator
1:27:02
has recommended which is first Susan Tucker who's our Director of Finance and then second Ben Swanson who's our
1:27:09
secretary to the mayor um and so I just have to do that as an announcement so that's my
1:27:15
designation um and that takes care of that and then the other one is Chris you wanted to read a command letter right um
1:27:22
I am supposed to read a command letter I don't really want to read it but um it's very perfunctory um this is to Susan
1:27:30
Tucker Director of Finance you are hereby commanded to collect by law and ordinance provided the several sums in
1:27:36
the tax roll specified as assessed against the persons or property here in mention for State County Municipal and

1:28:13

1:28:19

1:28:25
hand on the city of beacon on the sixth day of January and I truncated it a little bit but um this allows um Susan
1:28:33
to begin collecting taxes Which tax bills went out for the city um at the first of the month and we we get a
1:28:40
similar command letter from the county so we're also collecting their taxes

1:28:52
reports and let's start uh down at Pam your end um good evening um I'm wondering
1:29:02
well Happy New Year to everybody listening to the resident um asking
1:29:08
for more more info on the for the minutes of
1:29:15
it would be helpful to to I don't know if it would have to be in the minutes to
1:29:22
take advantage of AI and be able to have written what people are saying I know
1:29:28
when we were looking back at minutes from the planning board of what the public had said especially during public
1:29:35
hearings it was very very helpful for me to be able to see what was happening it
1:29:43
is you know I know you can listen to it on you know on the the YouTube however
1:29:50
it's a lot easier to see it in writing than it is to listen through you know
1:29:56
hourong meetings so I don't know if that can be at all considered in this day and age with AI opportunities um also I'm
1:30:05
just hoping that we um kind of what Amber has asked for in
1:30:10
the past adding to the agenda the mobility and access plans and complete streets and inclusionary Zoning
1:30:16

1:32:25
that it's widely more widely being recognized as the pain in the rumpus and
1:32:30
the the counter productive thing that it is there's nothing better than being in person or online and and giving direct
1:32:36
comment to us I really do encourage people to have these conversations community and connection is really
1:32:42
what's going to serve Us best in doing this so keep it off social media and come bring your comments directly to us
1:32:48
in one form or another um I'm working on coordinating meetings but I do encourage people to come to office out send email
1:32:54
or make comment requesting U meetings to be held to share information I'm working on W two meetings now they'll be
1:33:01
announced um but that's uh yeah that's that's the gist of it
1:33:06
great happy New Year others have said to everyone I want to Echo Pam's request to
1:33:11
talk about our Mobility needs and our non-vehicular transportation whatever we take that up at the Citywide level I
1:33:18
appreciate that we might need to wait until our city planner has more capacity than she currently has to get too far
1:33:24
along in the conversation but I think just having an initial conversation at the city council level at one of our workshops coming up this month or next
1:33:31
month would be great um Chris I have a couple of just questions for you I know Christmas tree pickup started the 27th
1:33:39
of December so I think just letting if there's an end date that's known yet look at that you got there great um the
1:33:45
other thing is now we are in the cold season where pipes are more likely to burst I'm curious about where we are
1:33:51
with the water meter replacement project and if those who already gotten it can see them that their their usage online
1:33:58
if they're away if not just kind of where that is that doesn't have to happen today if you need to follow up and see that um and then lastly I'm
1:34:04
going to have my ward office hours for Ward one on Friday June 17th that's not
1:34:10
this coming Friday but the following Friday from 4: to 6:00 p.m. at bank Square Coffee House and Lee I will pass
1:34:17
it to you okay um I just hope that everyone had um quiet and safe holidays
1:34:26
uh I enjoyed um a break and I hope uh the council did as well and I think
1:34:33
that's it for my Chris um a couple things our loop our Free Loop bus
1:34:39
started Sunday service this past Sunday and had 31 Riders which is great for a
1:34:45
really not so great day and um we're looking forward to that hopefully
1:34:50
expanding so please if you aren't aware yet that the bus is running on Sundays
1:34:55
the uh Duchess County Transit has the new um schedules online um they have
1:35:01
also augmented the other two buses that uh service Beacon the be line which goes
1:35:06
to pipy and is well used and May and Council uh Ben I don't know what's
1:35:14
happening uh F line to Fishkill is also enhanced so that people can get to
1:35:20
places where they shop and work um I just want remind um our community that
1:35:25
we still are in a stage one drought even though we've had quite a bit of precipitation we we're still recharging
1:35:32
the reservoirs um and that's why we haven't declared an end to that we will be picking up Christmas trees for the
1:35:40
next weeks at least um we do pick up bags and brush so if somebody wants to
1:35:45
keep it a little longer and Waters it um and puts it out later on we'll pick it up as well and I would just urge people
1:35:51
to please not put them in plastic bags and remove all ornaments and tinsel and
1:35:57
things that really can't be composted we chip these up and then they go into our compost piles down at the transfer
1:36:03
station and can you tell me when you do that so I can stand there and smell them
1:36:08
no that does sound we charge for that actually air fres maybe let me see I
1:36:15
don't know when it happens they might just do them as they come down so that would make more sense yeah um that's all
1:36:21
I have thanks okay um so let's do our laws and resolutions
1:36:26
the first one is um appointing George Manfield to position of Ward for city council member can I get a motion and a
1:36:33
second motion second so uh amber and Molly any discussion beyond that had in
1:36:39
the workshop um I would uh just encourage
1:36:45
anybody who is also interested in this position or any other position um
1:36:51
Council seats uh to think about that and um consider and look into steps for
1:36:57
running um now and if anyone has any questions about um what steps to take there I'm happy to
1:37:05
chat not belor this further because we did discuss it at length in the workshop I do encourage anybody who wants to
1:37:10
understand my vote to listen to the workshop note comments okay all right uh so all in
1:37:17
favor of appointing George Manfield to the award for city council positions say I I I anyone oppose osed yes
1:37:25
no so I I hear 5 to one um okay so resolution number two is appointing
1:37:32
Karen can I make a motion to cover resolutions 2 through n as a consent agenda
1:37:38
second uh so there's a motion in a second to cover resolutions 2 through n
1:37:44
as a consent agenda is that okay that is correct amend vote is just whether to place it as a consent agenda and to
1:37:51
clarify for a record each one will be taken will there will be one vote on all nine but the minutes will reflect a separate
1:37:57
vote on all nine being consistent with the vote on the um consent agenda if
1:38:03
anyone objects then that particular one should be objected to and it would be withdrawn and then you'd be voting on
1:38:08
seven or eight whatever the number all right so so first we would vote on whether we can do the consent agenda
1:38:13
okay right so there's a motion and a second for a consent agenda vote on resolutions 2 through n all all of which
1:38:21
are appointments to committees all in favor of doing that say I I I anyone
1:38:27

1:38:42
board of appeals uh Bob polii to the board of assessment review Pete Bailey
1:38:47

1:38:54
so that's uh Jeff and Palomo any discussion any desire to remove any of
1:39:01
those from the consent agenda I just okay I'm just looking at the agenda that
1:39:07
Andy Andrew B yeah but it's
1:39:12
correct right it's correct in the resolution right correct in the resolution yeah but that wasn't an objection to
1:39:19
pulling anyone off the consent agenda right no so all in favor of uh approving all eight of these
1:39:28
appointments say I I I anyone opposed okay the next one is a resolution
1:39:35
authorizing a city administrator execute agreement and that agreement would be with the gate house team at Compass uh
1:39:41

1:39:48
Molly and Pam any discussion
1:39:53

1:40:01

1:40:15
um five yes and one abstention which is uh treated as a no in terms of vote count correct but an an exstension all

1:40:30
