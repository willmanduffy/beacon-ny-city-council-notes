# Beacon City Council Meeting Summary

February 10, 2025

## Overview

The meeting began with Council Members Molly Rhodes, Jeffrey Domanski, Paloma Wake, George Mansfield, and Pam Wetherbee present. Mayor Lee Kyriacou attended remotely. City Administrator Chris White and City Attorney Jennifer Gray were also present.

## Proposed Local Law Concerning Use Regulations for Drive-Through Facilities and Self Storage Businesses [0:12]

### Current Situation
- Existing code lacks clarity on whether drive-through facilities are permitted
- Self-storage facilities currently fall under general warehouse/storage category
- No explicit statement about uses not listed in the code

### Proposed Changes
- New general provision: Any use not explicitly listed as permitted is prohibited
- Drive-through facilities:
  - Now explicitly listed as a prohibited use in all city districts
  - Previously had standalone language in CMS and linkage districts prohibiting them
  - This change makes the prohibition consistent across all zones
- Self-storage facilities:
  - Separated into their own distinct category (previously part of warehouse/storage)
  - Would be prohibited in all districts
  - Currently existing facilities would be grandfathered in as legal non-conforming uses
  - Cannot be expanded but can continue operating

### Key Discussion Points
- Drive-through prohibition:
  - Council generally in agreement about citywide prohibition
  - Consistent with city's goals for walkability and street activation
  - Affects potential future businesses like banks, restaurants, etc.
- Self-storage facilities:
  - More debate about whether complete prohibition is appropriate
  - Some council members suggested allowing in light industrial areas
  - Economic considerations: real estate costs likely make them impractical on Main Street
  - Mayor suggested possibly targeting prohibition to specific areas (Main Street, Route 52) rather than citywide

### Concerns Raised
- Questions about unintentionally prohibiting desired uses not explicitly listed
- Process for new uses:
  - Would require either zoning amendment (through City Council)
  - Or use variance (higher burden of proof, must show no reasonable return possible)
- Need for clarity on how common uses like grocery stores are categorized under retail
- Concerns about flexibility for future business types not yet known
- Economic viability considerations for different areas of city

### Next Steps
- Local law to be introduced at next regular meeting
- Will be referred to County Planning and City Planning Board with specific questions:
  - Input requested on whether self-storage should be allowed in any districts
  - If allowed, which districts would be appropriate
  - Economic and planning implications of complete prohibition
- Public hearing to be scheduled after receiving referral responses
- Council may modify approach to self-storage based on planning board feedback

## Extension of Special Use Permit for 416-420 Main Street [31:42]

### Discussion
- Request for six-month extension to June 2025 for project completion
- Previous extension granted to December 2024
- Original building permit issued June 2022 with 2-year completion requirement
- Temporary Certificate of Occupancy issued January 29, 2025
- Special use permit originally granted in 2021 with public green space as key component

### Status Updates
- Construction delays primarily attributed to materials availability issues
- Building inspector confirms substantial progress and completion expected by summer
- Public green space component not yet complete due to winter conditions
- TCO valid for 6 months (expires in April)
- Building department confirms applicant proceeding with due diligence

### Concerns Raised
- Importance of completing public green space component as promised
- Questions about enforcement mechanisms for incomplete elements
- Need for timely completion of all project elements
- Discussion of TCO limitations and requirements
- Council's ability to enforce completion of public amenities

### Next Steps
- Extension to be voted on at next council meeting
