2:00
didn't write all that down thank you okay so first on our agenda is the
2:08
proposed local law concerning use regulations for drive-through facilities
2:13
and self-service storage businesses and Natalie and Jennifer will
2:20
be um introducing this yeah I'm happy to jump in real
2:26
quick um so we what you have front of you this was discussed at the last Workshop meeting um and what you'll see
2:35
in terms of the local law is there was a provision added in section 22317 uh just to make it clear going
2:42
forward this is very standard language that you see in a lot of municipalities um that if a use is not expressly
2:47
permitted right if it's not expressly permitted within the zoning District or within the table that you presume it is
2:55
um you presume that it is prohibited right and and I think that there was some lack of clarity in there because
3:02
drive-throughs weren't a listed use um so that's kind of why we added that section in you'll also see that in
3:09
sections for the CMS district and the linkage District uh where there had been kind of Standalone language regarding
3:16
drive-thru facilities um that has been stricken now since everything is kind of covered within the um within the use
3:23
table and then the amendment um to attachment two the use table uh two
3:29
changes there self storage facility has kind of been pulled out as its own use
3:35
um we continue to prohibit that and all the districts that it was formally prohibited in um when it was when it was
3:41
kind of lumped with wholesale uh and warehouse storage and then also prohibited it prohibited that use within
3:49
the districts that uh line the Fishkill Avenue um the project area of the fish
3:54
Avenue committee additionally under permitted accessory uses uh drive-thru
3:59
facility whether Standalone or accessory is now listed um expressly listed and
4:05
again that is right now that is prohibited in all districts um we kept
4:11
it prohibited in the CMS and the linkage District as it was with that Standalone language um obviously kept it uh made it
4:18
prohibited in the residential districts and then by the time you kind of add in
4:23
um the districts that are in the fishco Avenue Corridor the only ones left were the Waterfront districts so it kind of
4:29
ends up being prohibited um in all districts so that was you know that's
4:35
what we drafted based on the conversation uh with the council at the last meeting I don't know if Jen has
4:40
anything to add but I think that's you know we wanted to get something in in front of the council for discussion um
4:46
and potential modification yeah I think the only thing I would add is procedurally you know
4:51
we're at a work session tonight obviously in preparation of your regular meeting next week so um provided that
4:58
this language is is suitable to you um this would be the local law that that you could introduce at your meeting next
5:05
week and then the next step would be to refer that to the County planning and and your city planning board for uh for
5:17
comment okay um anybody have anything to
5:22
say did that's so pretty uh yeah go ahead no go ahead pla
5:28
um I had a few questions um it was good relooking at this table um both this
5:35
week and last week um and I wanted to make sure I'm understanding um for one
5:43
why we put the drive-through facilities under permitted accessory uses as
5:48
opposed to parking in audio auto oriented or food
5:53
oriented um and sort of related I just want to make sure I'm understanding the permitted accessory uses
6:00
category broadly um because it does list for example parking structure which I
6:06
read understood and read to mean like a garage next to a personal residence in
6:11
which case as opposed to um under parking audio auto oriented off street
6:18
parking or parking structure above um I'm been wondering if we should be clarifying that for example to say
6:25
private parking structure or parking structures garage
6:31
yeah I can respond to those so drive-thru facilities is listed as accessory use because the drive-thru
6:37
component could be accessory to a number of different uses right you have Bank facilities sometimes that have
6:42
drive-throughs back in the day we had those dairy farm stores that had drive-throughs you have fast food
6:48
establishments with drive-throughs so the drive-through facility is an accessory component um to to other
6:55
permitted uses so that's why that was listed there and then why you see parking structure it's actually listed
7:00
both under parking Auto oriented right up there you'll see off street parking or parking structure and it is listed
7:07
again as parking structure accessory use so what that's distinguishing between is either a
7:12
standalone parking structure or off street parking facility that is the primary use of the lot right what you
7:18
would see in terms of like some of the municipal Lots versus what you're seeing down lower under the permitted accessory
7:25
uses when parking structure is listed there it's as reference as an accessory comp component to a larger development
7:31
right so if you would see what you would see is a mixed use development um maybe with uh parking
7:37
either adjacent to it or beneath it right under underground so that's talking about parking structures as an
7:44
accessory component to it development versus as a primary use and that's why they're distinguish in those two different sections so you're saying that
7:51
parking structure under permitted accessory uses would be an accessory parking structure not only for
7:58
residential but it could be for commercial use like in the general uh sorry no you're like trying
8:04
to read this table correctly uh yeah it could be accessory to to parking structure could be
8:11
accessory to anything to any use right it could be a hospital it could be accessory to um you know medical
8:18
facility commercial different commercial uses residential buildings so it's just what that's talking about there in that
8:24
section is whether or not you're allowed to have structured parking within um Within development as an accessory
8:32
component okay any other questions uh I mean my
8:39
other big bucket of questions was around the um this change in expressly prohibiting
8:48
non-listed uses um and I'd like to tease that out a bit more because I'm a little
8:54
concerned that we're prohibiting use some uses unintentionally but if other
8:59
folks had questions about other topics no I actually I had a question exactly about that you know it's almost
9:06
impossible to anticipate every per every possible use so if it's not described
9:12
then it would not be permitted if someone came up with something else say like a um a film studio or something
9:20
like that and it's not listed as a permitted use what would the process be about getting um would it be a variance
9:28
that they would be required to have so that process would be one of two things one it could be a use variance the more
9:34
likely scenario is that that particular property owner or or tenant would come to your board and seek a zoning
9:41
Amendment uh petition the board to have a film studio added as a permitted use in one or more of the districts okay so
9:48
the the language that was added to the code to say that any use not specifically permitted in the code is
9:54
deemed prohibited that's a general principle of zoning that if you you don't list it as a permitted use either
10:02
principally permitted or specially permitted it's deemed to be prohibited because otherwise you're you could
10:09
potentially allow any use right um under the sun uh under under certain
10:15
interpretations so it's it's a general zoning principle that wasn't explicitly
10:21
set forth in your code so we thought it was a good idea to put that in there to make it clear that um to to any you know
10:28
user and any person reading the code that if you don't see your use listed here in the table it's not allowed So in
10:36
theory if uh if if if this zoning language was in effect right now someone
10:42
who wanted to do a uh drive-thru they would come to us and ask for that for driveth through
10:48
to to be included possibly yeah I mean right so if this particular local law is goes
10:56
forward and is adopted and drive-through facilities are prohibited in every District if someone were to propose a
11:01
drive-through facility they would either have to seek a use variance to allow that drive-through facility or they'd
11:08
have to come back to the city council to seek a further zoning Amendment and from what I understand about use variants you
11:14
have to prove that all the other uses are not economically feasible right you can't get a reasonable return it's a
11:20
higher burden or uh obstacle to get over it is yeah use variances are are
11:26
difficult okay to secure Molly you had question uh yeah I was
11:34
going to say and maybe this is different than where my other fellow city council members are leaning that I I appreciate
11:39
the Elegance of this of being be ex being clear about what we expressly
11:44
allow and what we prohibit even within the boundaries there might be some other given our move to this we might decide
11:51
there are some other uses that we want to include on here particularly if we say oh something like a film studio
11:58
might be something we might allow in some of our districts so that might be extra work that then the city council
12:03
might want to consider um so I appreciate that both because it's in line as Natalie said with what other municipalities do and that it kind of
12:10
solves the immediate issue in an elegant way uh given our code I did have some
12:15
questions about self storage and prohibiting it throughout the city I don't have
12:21
any totally strong feelings one way or the other but I was like oh and I
12:26
started to think about and I actually started to focus particular on the light industrial districts and looking I appreciate that why it was included is
12:33
because there is some light industrial close to or within the boundaries of the particular Fishkill Avenue Corridor and
12:39
I saw I looked at light industrial areas in other parts of the city and so that was an area where I had questions um
12:46
about whether or not I appreciate there seems to be a number of them both within the city now and uh sort of fairly close
12:54
outside the boundaries of the city so this might not be an immediate thing that needs to be solved for it was an
12:59
area where I certainly felt more open um to ideas about it particularly given where our light industrial areas are and
13:06
the idea that maybe that might be the kind of business that's more acceptable to the uses that surround light
13:12
industrial uh whereas I feel differently about drive-throughs and the places that drive-throughs tend to be that tend to
13:17
be want to located they want that that through traffic and the The Pedestrian friendly heavier use that we're looking
13:23
to encourage that might be counter to that um so that's kind of kind of where I'm leaning right now I did have a
13:29
particular question that I think I know the answer to but want to confirm if we did adopt something either directly like
13:36
this or similar to it is my assumption correct that those pre-existing businesses that would no longer fall
13:43
into these permitted uses would they automatically be grandfathered in until they came before the planning board or
13:49
would that depend on the district and the zone that they're in so any use
13:54
that's currently legal um at this time if it were to be deemed prohibited under
14:02
the so say you had a self storage facility somewhere somewhere right in in any district and as you adopt this local
14:08
law that self- storage facility would no longer be a permitted use in that District it then becomes a pre-existing
14:14
legal non-conforming use and can continue it can't be enlarged or expanded upon but it can continue okay
14:22
great thank you so um can you all hear me yes yes okay great thank you I'm
14:30
sorry that I'm remote I just um think I told the council I just had a funeral so I apologize for not being there in
14:36
person um yeah where the issue that Molly raised um so I just want to talk
14:43
about that for a minute one um that particular isue I don't think is has any
14:48
time sensitivity to it um so you know that's the first thing and because of
14:53
that I would advise Council to be cautious in this area and then second um the reason that they were being isolated
15:02
as an item of concern or a use of concern is that it doesn't generate a lot of foot traffic and we're interested
15:08
in something zoning Route 52 or certainly our main street where we have
15:14
foot traffic I I don't see any particular reason not to include it elsewhere in the city in particular if
15:21
we're trying to move to a world where um apartments are smaller uh people don't
15:26
have cars uh that means they may be storing stuff and you know it would be nice if people could get through their
15:32
storage stuff without using a car which would suggest we need one in the city so
15:37
again I I for instance the one that exists off 52 maybe that's a perfectly fine place
15:44
to Zone it but uh on 52 I would understand that reasoning so I think we should be cautious
15:51
here yeah I was looking at that too Lee and I think where that current one happens to reside is in a light
15:57
Industrial area if I'm if I'm reading the map correctly and I Lee are you suggesting
16:04
that be cautious but come back to it and discuss it at a later date um um well we
16:12
have time so one option is to move forward on some but not others um if we
16:17
want to sort it now we just may want to be uh careful about maybe just limitting
16:23
limiting it that use in areas where we're expecting foot traffic you know
16:28
heavy foot foot traffic so that would be Main Street and 52 and maybe at the train station or something and if we
16:35
don't have a zone that does that we might want to think about a way to do it that fits correctly and that's why you
16:41
know we because we have time there's there's no deadline we we could think about it either way Jennifer may have a
16:47
view on how to go about doing this and I'd certainly defer if she's got some
16:53
ideas uh nothing beyond what what you've laid out mayor um I
16:59
I think you're right that it's self storage facilities are are traditionally you know very very very low trffic
17:06
facilities um let alone foot traffic just vehicular traffic um in uh in
17:12
addition to that so if you are looking to create a more vibrant you know uh you
17:18
act Street activated area self storage facilities doesn't isn't first in line
17:24
for um a compatible use for that particular vision so the mayor's right
17:30
somewhere like Main Street wouldn't make a lot of sense um but as far as you know
17:38
timing goes I mean look we have the the local law drafted with self storage facilities being prohibited throughout
17:44
the city uh pursuant to the discussion from the last meeting um if you want to
17:50
amend that in some way uh prior to introducing the local law at your next meeting we're happy to to do
17:56
that well the other option is to include it and then revisit it at at a later Point correct so by doing that you will
18:04
for a period of time um to the extent there are any self storage facilities currently operating in Beacon those
18:11
would for that period of time be deemed non-conforming uses and wouldn't be permitted to be enlarged or expanded uh
18:19
during that period of time until you revisit potentially and if we did revisit and they wanted to expand if we
18:25
changed it and they fell within the areas we now allowed it they wouldn't they would then be allowed to do that
18:31
they would yes yeah um one other thought that I had was including it but it
18:36
sounds like our next step at our voting meeting is before we set the public
18:42
hearing we send it to the planning board and the County planning board is there a way to draft a memo that we explicitly
18:48
ask for their input on those issues so we say this is our current proposal this is what we're considering do you have
18:55
any feedback on this particular element of are there any areas we should consider including self storage units
19:01
rather than prohibiting them throughout the city absolutely yes yeah yeah I'm I'm inclined to take that approach right
19:08
now I appreciate we're changing to not allowing them rather than that currently they're allowed and so we're sort of
19:15
forcing the issue but I feel like I'm I'm okay with moving forward in that way and kind of hearing feedback from our
19:22
our planning board and our our County planning board and then obviously the public when we get to that stage I'm curious um if others including Lee have
19:28
thoughts about about that again the only thing I'd add is um
19:33
ask yourself okay suppose that we were permitted use Citywide you think the
19:39
viability of a self storage on Main Street would ever exist I mean real estate so expensive the odds are zero
19:46
right and I think similarly on 52 the odds are extremely low so you know while
19:52
I appreciate we're thinking about this um I think the Practical effect is where
19:57
we permit them as a opposed to where we don't and I think simply saying you could have them Citywide you could be
20:03
almost assured like I'll make you a high bet it ain't ever coming on Main Street it's probably not coming on 52 right
20:10
because it's too expensive real estate now maybe on 52 there is more risk than
20:16
Main Street and I I think that's where we should be considering so it's my only two cents because I I just said I think
20:23
the odds are extremely small low because it needs large space that's cheap so so
20:29
you're suggesting allow it throughout the city but it's not going to happen as opposed to um not allow it throughout
20:36
the city and then they can come before us and yeah if so for instance if if we
20:42
thought we should end up with a unique um Fishkill Avenue District then we
20:48
could say okay I got a CMS don't you know we could exclude it even though it doesn't matter and then just in case we
20:54
could say well let's exclude it in in the fish kill District simply because because in the short run real estate
21:00
prices you know or you know might permitted by chance so that's what I'm
21:06
saying right now our only option is to do either LI or GB or something like
21:11
that where I think we want to be a little bit more targeted as to where it's not
21:22
allowed right does anyone have any concern other than Route 52 and Main Street for these me ask get the other
21:30
one um I would too if we did build a connector Road and before something else was built if the first proposal along
21:37
that Connector Road was uh was Self Storage yeah yeah we don't have one of
21:44
those yet but right but we could create a district for that or you that's what
21:49
I'm thinking I think we have a lot of flexibility on how to proceed on this and I just worry about zoning out rather
21:56
than um including something later on we don't
22:03
want I'm comfortable with Molly's proposal to put these set of questions
22:09
to the planning boards that will be reviewing the local law and to public comment um I'm open to
22:18
um uh perspectives on either side of this one and I agree with palman and Molly as
22:26
well yeah I can agree with would agree to
22:34
that yeah I I will say my impression of Beacon is that I feel like what what
22:40
what I like about the timing of this which was not intended this way is that I feel with an eye to the comprehensive
22:47
plan that we are getting to the place as a community where where we are able to
22:53
wrap our hands around what are the uses we actually want so to bring up the example the might have picked out of
22:59
thin air but Film Studio might be something we are okay with in certain areas and so talking about that more
23:05
explicitly and I appreciate that as a shift that for a time we we needed for for a really strong and true economic
23:12
reasons to be more flexible about that and I feel like we might be okay with moving away from that and maybe this is
23:19
the first potentially the first example of us doing that knowing that we might continue to iterate on this not least in
23:25
our comprehensive planning process
23:30
yeah I think the light industrial Zone in particular is where we have some of these potential middling uses um that
23:39
I'm interested in teasing out as
23:44
well Lee do you have any other comments I said I I think at least in my
23:51
head where I'm heading is that I view our um Li GB you know hi zoning as not
24:00
fit for purpose on Route 52 and I I can imagine us wanting something a little
24:06
bit specific to that um I think we need to be careful because we have industrial uses on 52 they generate jobs we want
24:14
that to continue but I I would my own two cents would be I I think this
24:19
discussion is better had when we can isolate that section because I believe that the only two areas we don't want
24:27
self storage in is um Main Street which economically doesn't matter it's not
24:32
viable Route 52 might be viable for a while so we might want to Zone that
24:37
specifically otherwise I kind of see permitting which is why I'm thinking you
24:43
know maybe we need to be reworking a specific Zone here and some sort of General either GBL combination
24:56
elsewhere Jennifer do you feel like we were specific enough to translate our questions or should we try and summarize
25:04
I think I mean so what what I took from it uh was that you are want to move forward with the Lo local law as drafted
25:11
and pose the question to the planning board um regarding self- storage facilities basic where should they be
25:17
permitted where should they be allowed within the city if there were additional questions let me know but that's what I
25:24
took from the conversation no I think you you said it correctly Jennifer I'm sort of in a way offering an option for
25:30
the planning board there's no reason to give it to them they'll sort it on their own I'm good I will say um in to get to
25:38
Circle back around um our shift in
25:44
explicitly um not permitting unlisted uses um the one use that I'm concerned
25:51
about though it's not timely is a grocery store and I'm not clear in reading the
25:59
table if that would be permitted under one of the existing categories or if that would need to be an added
26:08
use and that's retail I would think Jennifer is it I think so I'm just
26:13
looking at the uh the list here and Natalie chime in if you've got the uh
26:19
category handy but I mean it certainly is retail yeah I'm just looking there
26:24
something I hear Pal's point that it's not a grocery store isn't called out um
26:29
and that I guess you know that's kind of highlighting some of the gray areas of zoning is I think grocery stores are traditionally treated as retail I was
26:36
just going to look up the definition for retail real quick and that's kind of what your zoning administrator would do right if somebody came to them wanting
26:42
to place a grocery store somewhere um they would look to see if it fits within the definition of any of the expressly
26:51
permitted uses PR yeah and if you think the law is written covers that then I'm good um but
26:58
that's just the one that stuck out to me that's a good point yeah yeah I think by
27:04
adding this Clause to our zoning table it behooves us to spend a little time
27:09
going where Paloma and some others are going which is are the are the items on
27:15
our list now General enough to Encompass um all retail uses for
27:20
instance right because I what we're saying is that's good um you know I think where it gets harder in that
27:27
example of a film studio that's not selling anything so it's not retail it's
27:32
not office so there might be a category where we want to define something other
27:38
than retail and office where we it is a main street type use uh and we want to
27:45
permit it I don't know the answer to that but I would ask our fall under some sort of Arts use or
27:52
Art Studio I'm not sure kind of a question I had is like how much um room for interpretation is
27:59
there either with the building department or the planning board as that how to interpret these sometimes vague
28:05
you know things like retail so for example retail has a very specific definition right the sale of goods
28:10
directly to the general public for personal household or business consumption including but not limited to appliance store bakery delicates and
28:17
drugstore florist Supermarket hardware store liquor store New Stand Sho right
28:22
so it goes through a number of listed uses so I mean to the mayor's point I think that it could be a as we continue
28:29
to kind of look at the code that could be a useful um exercise is to take some of
28:35
the more general terms and look up how your code defines them and I think um we
28:41
might be able to see where there's some gaps where some some newer uses um are
28:46
adequately you know aren adequately defined within the
28:54
code for like some things we see a lot now that I see a lot of communities you know things like we have you know you
28:59
have daycare facilities and a lot of municipalities their code will talk about daycare facilities specifically
29:05
for children whereas now we're seeing daycare facilities for adults as a use that comes up so that's one that I see a
29:12
lot of communities I work in um trying to kind of modify those those
29:17
definitions so I think it's the points taken um I think it's a good exercise for us to do and I can I can definitely
29:23
take the lead on that great
29:30
I okay I had a very specific just question with the Amendments I saw for the part of what we're proposing for the
29:36
Central Main Street District that there was parts that were stricken but the word reserved in all caps was added in a
29:42
couple places and I just didn't I assume that's some coding art I you explain that that would be great sure it's just
29:49
you know you have that particular section that has that text in it now um and if we were to just eliminate that
29:56
particular section designation alog together then the whole code would need to be
30:02
readjusted uh to account for the elimination of that particular section so instead what we typically do is we
30:10
reserve that code designation I see so rather than having to have a new D and
30:16
and all the rest the letters you do that instead thank you for explaining that I appreciate
30:21
it hey hey Natalie when you take a look um I'm just seeing artist studio art
30:27
gallery exhibit space under office it may make more sense if there were a
30:33
separate category kind of where George was going you know that allow Film Studio or other things and maybe it's
30:41
separate from office in a individual category but do think about it and you know you're you're GNA give us advice so
30:48
thank you yeah no and I think that I think that's a good suggestion I think that goes to Molly's point about being
30:53
more expressly like encouraging the uses that the community knows they want right
30:59
and I think calling something out like that like Arts uses like that I think definitely is one way to send that send
31:04
that message through your code thank
31:10
you all right any other comments so we're going to move forward
31:17
as it's written with questions to the planning board on the self storage
31:30
okay thank you Natalie so I think
31:36
you're I get to go I I get to be free awesome thank you all so much
31:42
appreciate your time thanks you natal all right now on to extension of
31:48
special use permit for 416 through 420 Main Street Jennifer
31:55
will introduce that sure be happy to um so you have an application before you to
32:01
extend the special use permit approval for 416 to 420 Main Street this was a special use permit that was uh
32:08
previously granted in 2021 and part of the limitations is that
32:14
all the construction needs to be completed 2 years after the building permit is issued building permit was
32:20
issued in June of 2022 um which would have put the
32:26
deadline for all Construction be completed by June of 2024 last year you
32:31
did approve a six-month extension to December of 2024 the applicant timely
32:37
submitted another extension request seeking to have this further extended into June of
32:43
2025 uh we did reach out to the building department uh to find out the status of
32:49
construction um and to find out whether in the building inspector's opinion the applicant has been proceeding with with
32:56
due diligence towards the completion of construction and the building department confirmed that in fact they have most of
33:03
the delays have been um apparently attributable to um uh like materials
33:09
delays uh things outside of their control um but the building inspector did confirm that he believes everything
33:16
will be complete by this summer so um if not hopefully sooner um so our office has has no
33:24
concerns or or no objections to the city council moving forward with granting the additional six-month
33:33
extension can go ahead go ahead oh I was going to say can you I I see also in uh
33:39
the letter I guess from your office that the building inspector has granted a
33:45
temporary certificate of occupancy uh yes at the end of last month on January 29th can you say a
33:51
little bit about what that means in practice for the building part of this project yeah so t o um are typically
33:59
granted when like life safety issues have been addressed and maybe there are some finishing um items punch list items
34:07
that need to be completed um for example a good example is like Landscaping if a
34:13
building is ready to be occupied in the middle of winter but the Landscaping isn't isn't complete yet because the
34:20
developer can't install the Landscaping in the middle of the winter a TCO may be issued in that instance to allow for
34:26
occupancy the building and then once the warmer months roll around and the Landscaping can be completed the final
34:33
certificate of occupancy can be can be issued so that's one example of when tcos are
34:39
used so that means that people could start occupying or using the internal
34:44
part of the building even though the external Landscaping is not finished theoretically yes I don't know what the
34:50
specific there are specific condition may not do this yeah sometimes there are specific conditions on the TCO um
34:58
but theoretically yes occupancy can uh can uh can
35:07
start I I can keep going but have questions I'll come back to you any
35:13
other comments or questions no um so I I wasn't on Council when this
35:22
was originally approved but I did look back at and I I had I kind of followed along vaguely and I do remember that the
35:28
discussion of the Central Public Green Space was a big part of why why the council actually approved the special
35:34
use permit uh and which allowed the fourth floors particularly and it kind of it says that in the initial approval
35:41
um back in 2021 and so and I saw from the letter that it looks like that's the area that now that we're in winter with
35:48
the snow that is not ready to be open to the public yet so my question for you is
35:54
I'm I'm fine with this extension if we get to if they if they if we get into
35:59
the spring summer and they have yet to complete that part and they come back to us for another
36:06
extension is there what is the power of the C Council to start to say hey this
36:12
was a condition of your approval and now we're in the first summer where maybe other things are open the restaurants
36:17
open the businesses upstairs are open but that public park is not open what recourse do we have to make sure that
36:25
that actually happens in as Timely manner as possible so I think the best recourse is the fact that they're not
36:31
going to get their final certificate of occupancy until um that that is
36:37
completed um is a temporary one time bound I believe that it is uh each
36:44
municipality has different rules with respect to their TCO so I'd have to double check your code to see if and
36:50
under what circumstances that that time period um exists but I think that that's
36:56
the biggest back St as I usually call it um is the fact that they're they're not going to get their final Co your
37:03
extensions um are are really limited to changes of of circumstances or changes
37:09
of law um if there hasn't been a change of circumstance there hasn't been a change in the project there hasn't been
37:15
a change in the law um the the case law says that extension
37:22
should be granted great thank you it's not I I I assume there moving forward in good
37:28
faith this is more me just seeing that and having qu and and having heard the the conversation that that kind of
37:35
teasing that out took some time so just wanted to make sure before we even get close to that possibility um that I kind
37:40
of understood there that was it for me sounds like it might be helpful if that
37:45
temporary certificate of occupancy could be shared um with the council so we could understand those details if that's
37:53
possible and a temporary certificate of occupancy shall be effective for a period of time not to exceed 6 months
38:02
thank you under our code thank you
38:08
Chris allow speak you're not allowed to speak we do have expires in April and we
38:14
did includ a copy of
38:22
than Lee do you have any you wanted to add I'm
38:29
issue no I mean just just for the record I
38:35
noted that the um recording of the July 1st extension doesn't show the vote count in
38:41
there on the table at the end it just seems like it's just the pre before the law so that should just be updated for
38:48
the record you referring to when the council
38:54
voted on it July of last year correct yeah
39:05
all right so we'll ready to have this ready for the council
39:10
meeting next week yes okay and
39:20
now on to our last item on the agenda 2025 city of Beacon priorities and Lee
39:28
you are going to lead us on that discussion yeah that's why I'm on the
39:33
call this evening um so um let me uh I
39:39
hope you've all had a chance to look um it hasn't changed since then although we
39:44
would probably make some corrections in additions what I would suggest is that
39:50
we kind of go down each section see if there's any questions and then we keep going because I think that there the
39:57
reason I put this together was you know the council's role in terms of policy
40:02
and budget um is relevant here most of the things and the top are not the
40:08
council's job right the administration meaning the execution of these projects is you know under the city administrator
40:16
and the mayor um but it's here because it's helpful to see here's the list of things that has to get done and that are
40:23
getting done this year most of these items are this year a couple of them will extended the next year occasionally
40:29
we'll shift something back for some reason or another so we just want you to see this and then get to the back which
40:35
is okay what new things might we want those are that's getting close to policy
40:40
where I'd ask that we spend some time focusing so we did a list um at the back end but there's probably some more
40:46
things and it'll give the council a sense of okay you can put something in
40:51
the queue but you got to clear stuff out first you might have to find funding might take a little while but that might
40:57
be a better way than you know a council member just raising hey somebody said this can we get this done now and it's
41:04
like generally that's not how it works takes longer to cue something up find funding so that's what this is about
41:11
does that generally make sense before we go through it uh just uh if the Public's looking at
41:17
this uh this could you uh Define like HML oh sure um so you
41:25
know this isn't meant to be you know a definitive Gant chart or anything like that this is nothing like that in fact
41:32
um you know we would not use one this is done to give it just a sense of how much time it would take so the projects are
41:40
organized first into capital projects then operating projects and then divided
41:45
into which department is doing the bulk of the work and then what additional time might happen with other groups so
41:53
the column that says under time Department right in the first section it's the highway department that's doing
41:59
a lot of this work um there's a couple of other departments in that first list but it's mostly highway so that column
42:06
is giving you a sense of is it a lot of their time is it a little of their time so it's just high medium low not more
42:12
than that same with Administration Administration refers to uh largely you
42:17
know Chris myself Ben but also um legal suppor if there is some that's not you
42:22
know primary job uh engineering support um support and so again kind of a high
42:29
medium low um and it's not more than that right the other columns are just
42:35
telling you you know how much D are we talking about and is it city tax money
42:40
or do we have it from another source and anytime we can get it from another source that's really worth doing
42:45
especially for large projects and especially if we can get the funding it's worth waiting for so
42:57
that helpful enough y all right so let me just run you
43:04
through that first list the first one uh are capital projects you can see at the top of the list is finishing fish kill
43:10
teller right and um as you know that's somebody else's money and it's you know
43:17
a huge win for us to have been able to basically save the loss of that funding
43:23
by getting this job queued up and done um there's always milling and Paving some of that is covered um by our annual
43:31
uh chips money some of it is covered elsewhere um there's some other items including some Park workor uh the
43:38
biggest item on the table that is ours um is the um highway department
43:47
vehicle equipment which uh we can't get I think we have to use our own money uh
43:52
and then the other one is part you know doing Park Avenue I don't think we've got funding for that do we Chris
43:58
somewhere else that's the rehab in the bathrooms South um we have a a member item from uh
44:07
Jacobson's office okay so it's a small a small plus right it's either 125 or 150
44:14
I'm forgetting I gotta thank Jonathan again St um it's always an excellent
44:21
source of funds s womman does a great job of helping us with things so we'll get that included in there and that
44:27
makes it a lot easier um there's a few items on this that I might have gotten wrong Chris you said I
44:34
wrote uh no I think this this section is okay I think I did all right on this
44:40
section maybe the visitor center bathroom it sounded like there wasn't more steps to that yeah is that on is
44:48
that on the first section or is it after this it's number 11 uh Lee on the first
44:54
section yeah so I had thought we were going to try to face the bathrooms outward and I think I'm incorrect on
45:01
that Chris you're going to help me uh to be determinedly okay so um yeah so this
45:08
isn't going to get done unless we can do something like that we've rehabilitated uh the bathrooms when they
45:13
repainted is that correct in The Visitor Center the The
45:18
Visitor Center exterior has been repainted we are cleaning the bathrooms now
45:24
regularly um once we reactivated the Center um we did add an element of uh a
45:31
contractor coming in to make sure those bathrooms were clean but they're only open when the center is
45:38
open okay yeah so this is incorrect right I had assumed we had a project uh
45:45
teed up here and we don't so that one should just come off the
45:51
table anything else on that first bucket
45:58
um when you get to items 20 and 21 those are not the Howe Department um but you know I because this list includes
46:05
everything in our in our Capital plan uh for the current year and for prior years
46:10
that aren't complete that's why there's an item 20 for um vehicle purchase by
46:16
police again largely somebody else's money and then the other big item here is for a ladder truck not sure where uh
46:24
Chris you think are we going to try to get that this year we're either going to order it or we may
46:30
have an opportunity to buy a truck that was uh fabricated for another municipality that then didn't want it um
46:38
so we're we're seeing if that's possible because we could save hundreds of thousands of dollars on the truck so
46:44
again to to be determined we're playing it out okay so that's a good example of
46:51
you know uh is it where we do we have to do it right now we're going to we're going to at some point we put it in our
46:57
Capital plan but there's some play and some judgment call that can save taxpayers you know a quar million
47:03
dollars or a half a million dollar but if that doesn't work out we will be ordering it this year because it's a
47:08
four to five year lead time on these trucks Council good with that said I
47:16
just want to uh double check that the skate park rehab includes the public art
47:22
um space that we had discussed as well it will great
47:28
yeah we met with the high school students was it last week or the week
47:33
before and Mark prices all over it okay that's
47:40
awesome okay so that's the first set the second set um is these are also capital
47:46
projects um but they're water and store right or wastewater treatment PL so I just you know largely the effort there
47:53
the department involved is either going to be water or the wastewater treatment PL so either you know um the people who
48:00
the department heads there have a significant amount of work on the projects because they have to oversee it
48:06
and then uh to a lesser degree there's you know effort by you know Chris and
48:11
myself with some oversight that's what's meant here and and the meter upgrade has been um very quite a bit of work for our
48:19
finance department as well because they've had to um figure out how the new
48:25
meters are talking to the old system system so that's that's been a significant investment of time by our
48:32
finance department and Susan Tucker yeah absolutely um and um Finance
48:39
is one of the areas that's has been consistently overworked and we're just cautious there because um it's also our
48:46
you know people we really want to keep so yeah the one item here that has some
48:52
uncertainty um it didn't in our first draft with the mzinga dab rehab do you want to talk about what you're thinking
48:59
or what we're thinking there yeah we're going to hold mzinga Dam Rehabilitation until next year um we applied for a $2
49:07
million Grant this year we didn't get it a number of municipalities around us did get it we've done a debrief with the
49:14
agency um we'll be seeking that funding next year and trying again um and our we
49:20
have a an authorization to do the work um and that doesn't Sunset until 2029 so
49:26
we we have some time there's no imminent danger um but we do need to do the work
49:31
in the next years right so there there'll be some prep work on you know the
49:37
administration's part of getting that in and trying to get it across the Finish Line obviously if we can move 3.9
49:44
million you know to move a couple million over into somebody else's money we're trying to do that um there are a
49:50
couple of big items here that you know we are self-funding we're going to be bonding for um and this is PID were from
49:57
water and sore fees not from U you know property tax revenue uh I will note uh
50:03
and I pulled up a study there was a a shared service study I think it was 2015
50:09
the the village and town of fish and city of Beacon looked at um wastewater treatment doing that together and um it
50:18
that study while it didn't move forward um did point out that uh our plant the
50:23
wastewater treatment plant was pretty much at its age and that started us down the process of doing not a new new plant
50:30
but starting to replace the core components and that's what you're seeing on this
50:35
list and the roof replacement number 30 is nearly done that should be wrapped up
50:41
this week well and I'm I'm hoping you're going to tell me that the uh cost is a
50:48
fraction of what we wrote down um that's true cool what fraction it is I don't quite
50:55
remember but it's um one of the things probably about a quarter of what we had initially wow
51:03
yeah yeah one of the things that Chris has has focused on is building the highway department uh Team of folks who
51:11
do building support and you know when you can wield them in to get Construction done like a roof or a
51:18
locker room or whatever it's turned out to be um a really effective way of saving taxpayer money so thank you for
51:25
that okay just to before you move on to this
51:31
section I assume these are all these are all capital projects in this section so these are all ones that we already discussed and approved for for Capital
51:38
funding we haven't necessarily gone had to go out to bonds yet but these are ones all ones we've discussed so yeah
51:44
and and some of the capital projects are years in the making I just look back quickly and um like the we play project
51:51
that we did last year had been approved in 2020 uh the South Avenue
51:57
the first work on the retaining wall was originally approved in 2017 Fishkill
52:02
Avenue goes all the way back into the early 2000s so um there is a lag
52:08
sometimes and and as the mayor said we look for grant funding sometimes we have complexities that make the grant the the
52:15
project go on longer than it should um and sometimes it's just bandwidth like we we put off South Avenue because we
52:23
play with such a a demand on on our recre Department's time last
52:29
year thank you we did we did the roof for
52:36
$117,000 and it was bid out so you're thinking the locker room
52:42
which we did inhouse for even less than that you're
52:47
right okay and yeah when it was in the capital plan we used the dollar amounts
52:53
that were in the capital plan unless we had a better estimate um because you know might have been from a couple years
52:59
ago okay so the next section are the operating projects we we put the capital
53:04
ones up first um and so these are operating projects so the dollar amounts are generally less a lot of them are
53:12
just made up uh because you know we really don't know but we're basically saying these are not expensive but they
53:18
may be a significant time sync either for the administration or for the
53:23
Department that's involved in the work right so that first set um are all
53:30
negotiations and so that has to be done with legal um obviously we've got um you
53:38
know our collective bargaining agreements in there we've got uh Building Sales to take care of there's
53:44
an easement with New York state parks for the mount Beacon Tank uh there's an agreement with the fur Trail on their
53:50
maintenance facility um there's the you know application and agreement with
53:55
Hudson River housing right at the top so those are all items you may have heard of you know they do take up time I think
54:03
the Adu one is getting close U the other ones are moving along and others are put
54:08
off you know until they have to get done Chris would you add anything on the
54:14
agreements and the contracts um I would say that the the big investment of time on this are the
54:21
two major contracts with our firefighter and uh police unions
54:27
um the Royal cing should be fairly straightforward they're willing to roll
54:32
over their 2019 price for another year um so we've asked I I confirmed that
54:39
last week and I'll be working with the um attorneys to draft something on that to bring to you um and the both
54:47
firehouses we expect to be listed in early April we're getting them
54:54
ready all right the next section is for in particular
55:00
Finance has a question has a question I wasn't sure what number 41 was Main
55:06
Street shared private parking lots um uh Chris you want to do that one
55:12
or yeah we we've been exploring arrangements with um private parking lot
55:18
owners to see if we might um be able to make an arrangement where the that lot
55:24
becomes a public parking lot in exchange for us plowing it and taking care of it
55:30
um we had a conversation for instance with the owner of the former city hall
55:35
next door to um ma hook and ladder that might be in the offing at some point but
55:42
right now he wasn't ready for it um similarly we've had preliminary conversations with MNT bank with um the
55:50
Islamic teaching Center a couple others um just to put feelers out um looking
55:57
towards a shared parking system um a lot of these are only used for a small
56:02
amount of time during the week and um you know again if if for instance the
56:08
property owner next to us by Maze decides that they want to do that then we can actually reconfigure the parking
56:14
lot so that you get um the hole is bigger than the sum of the parts because
56:20
I can configure it in a way where we get more parking spaces got it thank you
56:26
okay you can continue Lee okay so the next section just the admin one just was
56:33
isolating as Chris said the um work on the new water meter system for finance
56:38
and getting the billing right is a a big uh investment of their time so we just wanted to isolate it it doesn't cost
56:45
anything but it's a lot of their time plus they have to do the hotel tax collection now uh as well so we just
56:53
wanted to isolate those those those um we both are trying to get those to come online you know this year all right so
57:00
as as I recall we were asking the county if they could collect our hotel tax did
57:06
that did they decline that offer or request I I can feel thisly if you want
57:12
um they didn't necessarily decline it it was actually easier for us to get the um
57:18
the package the software package from granicus we already have um a software
57:24
system for identifying airbnbs um they also have a collection nodule that you
57:31
can buy it um so we're going to be doing that and that's what the county uses so
57:36
after multiple conversations we figured out that would be the easiest way and we hope to go live on that in April thank
57:46
you right so the the next section is planning zoning obviously you know we
57:52
were talking about that this evening we just tried to do a list of you know where are we heading what are we
57:57
thinking about again there's some flexibility in this but I just did a cut at it right um the council had asked for
58:04
a speed limit reduction um meaning the 25 mph Citywide except where the state
58:10
controls the speed limit and um we heard that and um Chris arranged to get it
58:15
funded by somebody else or getting close to getting funded we're not there yet Chris um we're close I spoke to The
58:22
Duchess County transportation Council which is doing one of these for the city of to kipy under under their United
58:28
planning United planning work program um they're hoping to be able to do that this year for
58:35
us so they would actually conduct the study so that
58:41
um because they have experience with it now that they've done pipsis so that's a good example because
58:49
that was one where um the council raised it several times and we said you know we can't do this instantly put it in the CU
58:56
try to get someone to fund it you know you know a round or two later meaning not the same year we can put it on the
59:03
table get it done right we're not quite there yet but that's what that one is and initially the guidance from the
59:08
state was um confusing and it wasn't clear what what an engineering study was
59:15
so in the law it said you could do this if you do an engineering study and then there the question follows well what
59:22
what do you need to do to to meet that standard um so I I think they figured it out now
59:30
we you know the county has one of these under its belt so we're ready to go next
59:36
hopefully this year okay the the next one I think you've all heard about um this is the
59:43
beakman street complete streets um which Chris just successfully put in the $3.8
59:49
million uh application to the County Transportation uh Council um we're
59:55
hoping to get you know 3 million from them and that we would pay the rest it's in Brackets because we don't know yet
1:00:01
and and we're not clear that any federal funding is going to be forthcoming so again I I'll take it with a you know a
1:00:09
grain of salt whether or not this even comes through right at any
1:00:14
level then the other items under planning zoning and again most of the work uh that in terms of Department
1:00:20
means planner and legal right that's how to think about the department column in this section and you know what we do for
1:00:27
the fur Trail uh what we do for the U Beacon Hopewell uh rail trail whether
1:00:34
it's finishing the feasibility study so the county has funded that I don't think I have the dollar amount right for their
1:00:41
feasibility study but maybe I do um and then looking at the recommendations from
1:00:46
the pishill Avenue committee doing the Zoning for it um other zoning so that's
1:00:51
what that's about and then figuring out what the DMB lot is up to
1:00:57
mean the County's lot and and the mayor and I met with County Executive Sereno on Friday and
1:01:04
our top ask was the rail trail because there is no um solid plan there's a
1:01:11
feasibility study that's being undertaken um and we we are starting a
1:01:17
conversation before that's finalized this summer to say we'd really like the
1:01:22
county to take this on as as you have on the other three rail rail trails in the
1:01:28
county was she receptive to that yeah she was very she was very open um no
1:01:33
commitments because I think they're they're waiting to see the results of the feasibility study and how much that
1:01:39
might cost and how it might be phased and we of course pitched that we
1:01:44
would be the first phase the uh but I I think there's a
1:01:50
good logical argument for it the positive news was when we met with the county exec she brought her chief staff
1:01:56
which you know comes everywhere but also the head of the planning department R was there and we were very pleased to
1:02:03
have them because they recognize that our our needs and interests are center around planning that rail trail um their
1:02:11
Housing Programs but again our number one as Chris said or you know is rail
1:02:18
trip okay as this came up in reference to this number 52 did you mention the
1:02:24
DMV lot or you really want to focus on the rail trail for this particular meeting we we mentioned it um and we we
1:02:31
talked a bit about housing and our partic our participation in the Adu program that we're doing with Hudson
1:02:38
River housing and um so she's aware that we're interested in it and the Mayor Lee
1:02:44
why don't you the mayor brought it up too okay yeah um yeah obviously we're
1:02:49
we're interested in where they're going um they weren't prepared to you know discuss it at the time so that there's
1:02:55
you know something they're working on um but that's you know they know it's important to us and they all we also
1:03:01
told them that we viewed that as our could be a model for us to use publicly
1:03:07
owned space along Main Street parking lots for you know the ability to do
1:03:13
housing in a way that would create more affordable than the standard inclusion area
1:03:19
zoning am I completely making up that they um put out an RFP no you're
1:03:26
absolutely correct it was an a request for expressions of interest thank you um
1:03:32
and they had several viable responses I think where they got delayed is
1:03:40
that my understanding is Duchess County doesn't have a mechanism to do this other than a bid um like a straight um
1:03:48
bid that is only about the dollar value um whereas olster county has a law that
1:03:53
allows it to consider public public interests such as housing and I think Duchess was exploring how they could
1:04:01
match what we used to do in oler
1:04:10
County all right you four with me uh through 50 items so thank you um you
1:04:18
know we're getting close to the back of the list which means stuff that is um less set in stone and then this future
1:04:26
projects is you know Chris and I kind of worked their way through so what's in the queue and there's a number of things
1:04:32
that people don't talk about that are in the queue and should be in the queue so for instance from our Main Street um
1:04:39
work on that that committee they talked about bathrooms they talked about reconfiguring East Main and Main Street
1:04:46
intersection reconfiguring Churchill and Main Street so we just started up a list
1:04:52
of things we may want to be doing if the you know rail line is abandoned we may
1:04:57
want to do those intersections uh faster than the county is ready to help us fund it so that's what this list is about
1:05:04
here starting in 101 I just decided to start a higher numbering system there could be other items there was an email
1:05:11
from Amber reminding U me that we had intended to put something about Communications in this list um but this
1:05:18
would be the area where you know we'd like some input or you know these the right items are there more are some of
1:05:24
these higher priority than others because these are things that aren't set in stone yet and we would need to plan
1:05:32
figure out how to fund and start to queue up over time right not happening in a day I'll stop there could I throw
1:05:39
out a couple at this point that I would suggest um yeah well one that we've
1:05:45
talked about in the past and that we're going to do I assume but the comp plan I'm not sure where that would be
1:05:50
included and if that's such a thing that should be included in this list um
1:05:56
you mean the update yeah y y u because that does entail a certain expenditures
1:06:02
I believe and attention um I would like to it may not
1:06:08
be possible or feasible at this point but I would like to at least have a conversation about u a community center
1:06:16
and what we would hope that could achieve and what uh um you know like a feasibility study
1:06:22
or so determining what our needs are as a community and if it takes a building to be built
1:06:28
or can we use existing structures and programs but I I think it would be wise to figure out what we need and how what
1:06:35
a community center could possibly serve the purpose that it could serve in the community so at minimum i' like to have
1:06:42
a study and determine that we as a community are providing um you know a
1:06:48
sense of community and support to U both our volunteers our seniors and our youth
1:06:54
um so I it's a conversation is the best way to start yeah I appreciate it George
1:07:00
yeah the item 120 was um my you know just writing down hey look you know the
1:07:05
rec center is the closest thing we have doing the renovation um might you know be the same
1:07:11
thing it might not so I think you know you're describing it as a broader question first um is certainly fair and
1:07:19
we can have that discussion but I I would put it with 120 obviously if we want to do a separate structure
1:07:25
somewhere else then we may not want that building at all so I mean I think it it should start with establishing what our
1:07:32
needs are as a community and what's not being addressed at this point and how we can address things better um so I would
1:07:39
like to have that conversation you know within this year if possible yeah I'd second that I completely agree and
1:07:46
George the way you described it that it's not you you talked about a study when you talked about finding out what the community needs are and
1:07:52
conversations I've been having with council members and with the mayor is having those conversations there's much
1:07:57
that can be discovered much that can be done short of doing a formal study and how do we introduce that into our
1:08:03
conversations and so I think in not too distant future we'll be talking about my um interest in having a a parking lot
1:08:10
place on our agenda where we can prioritize and have some conversations because I think short of a formal study
1:08:16
there's a lot of work that we can identify that needs to be done in very cost-effective ways to discover that
1:08:22
information and I'm particularly Keen as well on uh Community Resources third spaces um very you know there's
1:08:29
potential interest in developing a community center but I think the pathway to developing Community Center there's a lot of resources that do exist and could
1:08:36
benefit from conversation uh with the community about identifying and how to draw attention to them and how to
1:08:41
support them in other ways
1:08:47
okay will I'm sorry go ahead no go ahead Lee if you I just want to point out on
1:08:53
this topic that um I don't know Chris you got the number handy but I I think the wreck budget uh since I've been
1:09:00
mayor has doubled um and so you know part of our focus is programs as opposed
1:09:06
to edifice and um we think that's a correct approach that doesn't mean we
1:09:12
might not do something involving structure at some point but you know I'd
1:09:17
much rather have the programming and we can get it sooner other than later which is what we've been doing I agree um I
1:09:23
mean I I do believe ultimately if we could afford it if in a perfect world
1:09:28
you know everything Under One Roof U creates a certain Synergy with all the groups that operate under that common
1:09:35
roof so I think there's a benefit to you know a center place but I understand the
1:09:41
reality may not allow that so I I think that at minimum we should start the
1:09:46
conversation um so thank you I'll just add my two cents that I share your vision George of a shared space that um
1:09:55
and house that Synergy um I know that we do we did do the recreation study a few
1:10:02
years back and I think there is a lot that can be built from from that study
1:10:07
um but that um I think the first step is a broader conversation as George is
1:10:14
suggesting uh looking holistically at our community needs alongside the
1:10:20
specific data we have around recreational needs yeah and I don't I'm sorry expand
1:10:26
the conversation and the thought process expand our minds if you will to the overlap around the communications plan
1:10:32
that we've discussed and council person Grant raised in her email and we've discussed in previous meetings that it's
1:10:38
not just necessarily City resources the rec center program there's other programs there's other
1:10:45
organizations um that could contribute to the broader mission that we're trying to achieve and would identify through
1:10:50
this conversation okay
1:10:56
and the last thing I just wanted to throw out there and I'm not sure what the state of it is or but I think that
1:11:02
if at some point we could get an update or figure out what the future of the University settlement is on a larger
1:11:08
scale not just the pool um or the grounds but just if if there is a you know a future plan for it
1:11:15
and what place that might you know what role that might plays in the uh in our whole
1:11:22
Rec U program yeah um Chris do you want to comment on
1:11:28
that because it it is a it is a um a contingent item that we have to kind of know the answer to that first um Chris
1:11:36
you want to add on that so we don't own the university settlement camp we are
1:11:41
using it under a 20year agreement from New York state parks that expires in um
1:11:48
2028 and then it can be renewed for another 20 years um I have already
1:11:54
seeded the idea with New York state parks that we would like to buy the park for a dollar from the state so that we
1:12:01
can invest in things that have a useful life of more than 20 years um right now
1:12:07
I only have an agreement till 2028 so it's really hard to go to bond Council and say Well we'd like to fix this roof
1:12:13
which has a a 25y year um probable useful life um if if they were to sell
1:12:20
it to us it it it helps us be able to make the investments in it um so I think what we do there really
1:12:28
depends on how they react to that so we've we've approached them at the region about it um we haven't taken it
1:12:35
much further because we have a number of years yet and there's a lot of other stuff coming up um also in wck before we
1:12:42
leave that I do want to note that we have a number of projects pending from prior um Capital programs so we we have
1:12:51
a full design and funding for the renovation of Riverfront Park Pete and
1:12:58
Toshi Seeker Riverfront Park um and that has has just been waiting we can do
1:13:05
about one project a year um I know last year we got really bogged down with we
1:13:10
play so we had to put off South Avenue Park it's it's a huge stretch for us to
1:13:15
get that done this year we were hoping to look at maybe um Riverfront Park next
1:13:21
year um in 2026 and that way we know the outcome of what might happen with the to
1:13:27
as well so some of the things we've held because we're not clear like with the Tod some of the ideas went over the
1:13:34
railroad into the park and we didn't want to rebuild a park and then have part of it you know ripped up and
1:13:42
alternatively we might have somebody else be able to pay for the improvements um so a lot of a lot of the
1:13:48
things we we still have things cued up that never got done like if you look at beakman Street for instance that study
1:13:55
about a complete Street was done in 2018 um so so again I'm I'm still
1:14:02
working off things that the council in the you know 2017
1:14:07
2020 last year um queued up yeah you know Chris you I forgot the
1:14:15
the Investments we've done in Parks so not only have we done the operating budget doubling of wreck we've also done
1:14:22
major Capital Improvements for all our parks and you know those are the choices
1:14:27
that you put them in the in the capital plan we executed them so you know we
1:14:33
just need to be measured about how we go about it and George you know I heard you say exactly that that you know it'll
1:14:40
depend and we need to look at it holistically um but if we have uh the ability to invest in University
1:14:46
settlement because you know the state isn't hanging on to it and we actually control it and own it uh and we have uh
1:14:54
West Center Street and we have you know a facility for meetings on Main Street
1:15:00
meeting the memorial building those are strong assets to be used along with our Parks so that'll be part of the puzzle
1:15:06
when we look at the whole picture right and another piece with settlement Camp is just what's the what's the remaining
1:15:13
useful life of the pool right um and and is there going to be money available
1:15:19
from New York State they've finally after Generations opened up a funding source for building New Pools which are
1:15:26
really expensive because they have to be ADA Compliant you have to be able to walk in not walk in but you have a
1:15:32
gradient entry Entry Way um and they and they're very expensive and if we were to
1:15:38
rebuild a pool I'm not sure I would put it at the settlement Camp because it's really hard to walk to unless you're on
1:15:45
that side of town I mean relative to what we're talking about um but in general I think one of the the value of
1:15:51
this this list that Lee has put together it's not only action plan but it's an aspiration plan yeah and I think it's
1:15:57
also good for the community to see that we're thinking about these things we may not have the funds or the ability right
1:16:04
now but it's we're not not thinking about it right so I think there's there's value to just seeing it and even
1:16:10
having conversations because a lot of people ask they go to university camp and they see these Fallen buildings down
1:16:16
it seems like an opportunity wasted and people wonder what's happening there so every once in a while just to put a
1:16:23
reality check on it you know maybe when we have Mark in for the capital program in may we can talk a little bit more
1:16:29
about the buildings the short answer is we asked to take numerous buildings down
1:16:34
there the smaller cabins up on the hill because they don't have proper footings there there's no structural Integrity to
1:16:41
them some of them have trees in the roof um and it was quite onerous process to
1:16:47
go through it took state parks a year just to tell us what the onerous process would be and that's when we said well
1:16:54
maybe we'll will try this a different way so we haven't been able to take any of them down yet um we have we have been
1:17:01
doing basic maintenance and I U we do have a caretaker there Andrew Stevens from our um water department and he's
1:17:08
been an amazing resource up there getting it tidied up looks better than it ever has yeah and that's Andrew so
1:17:15
and Mark Mark price but we we can have that
1:17:21
conversation we're we're lining up the next Capital program to bring to you the first meeting in May and when Mark is
1:17:27
here let's talk more about it I may have more information from what the state's perspective is on it thank you the other
1:17:35
thing we had hidden Brook on here and I you know I know people have asked because there are rumors that hidden
1:17:40
Brook is for sale we're clearly interested in the in in the outcome of that property we've we've had one
1:17:47
preliminary conversation with the church they're not sure what they're doing yet but we know that if the opportunity
1:17:54
comes up to conserve that land um that that will be on this list as
1:18:02
well Chris are there any other you mentioned Pete and Toshi Seager Park Renovations are there any other projects
1:18:09
like that that we've talked about in the past that aren't yet on this list that we should just be aware of yeah there's
1:18:15
um a walkway around Memorial Park that um we put in a a previous Capital
1:18:22
program for 525 ,000 um that would basically build out the walkway that we
1:18:28
have on Wilks and have it circumnavigate the park so you had you know a nice area
1:18:34
that you could jog or use a stroller or um teach a kid to ride a bike um we're
1:18:40
doing the skate park improvements that that was an in a capital program came out of participatory budgeting but we're
1:18:46
going to do that this year um we also have improvements
1:18:52
just that never made it onto Capital programs like we're doing the um
1:18:58
softball fields this year because the students raised that we know the basketball courts over at Memorial Park
1:19:05
um need attention so as as we can um you know we'll be trying to do smaller
1:19:10
projects as well to improve the physical facilities you mentioned pickle ball at
1:19:16
one time at so you know there was an area that once at at one point was identified for a baton cage it never
1:19:23
came to fruition um we think the the use of a pickle ball court would be more
1:19:29
frequent and um appreciated maybe than a batting cage which is very seasonal um
1:19:35
so we're looking at that for the old tennis court that's behind the skate park just to clarify about the um ball
1:19:44
field it it is listed as number 14 to address the fencing the other issue that
1:19:50
they raised was the flooding which I understand was more complicated is there been any fact finding about what we
1:19:56
could do about that no not yet we'll we'll look at it I mean they they know
1:20:02
there are areas that need to be leveled out over there and as we're doing the fencing i' I've asked them to take a
1:20:08
look at it yeah I'm guessing that um Memorial Park is always going to have some water
1:20:14
issues it's it's a function of where it's located but let's find let's find out and it's hard to figure out where to
1:20:19
run that water too there's no pitch or yeah the one I also want add as you
1:20:25
look at item 111 um denning's Point has had a change and I I think you all aware
1:20:31
of this that Clarkson University has pulled out of the rivers and estro buildings there and they've now gone to
1:20:39
the state park Chris correct me if I got that wrong and that uh state parks is
1:20:44
now starting to think about what do they want to do with the building so here's this very cool building that's been
1:20:50
built that we have some saying I don't know yet yeah we've been invited to meet
1:20:56
with State Park Cena Hudson Clarkson and other partners um and they're arranging
1:21:01
that the building is not in very good condition though but you said it's owned
1:21:07
by state parks it's owned by state parks but it had been used by Clarks and um
1:21:12
and apparently major systems in the in the building are in dire need of
1:21:18
replacement it's not an old building yeah I heard it's not in good
1:21:28
shape um just while we're on the topic of parks I know there's been some very
1:21:34
preliminary conversations about a Fishkill Riverfront Park um below I'm
1:21:41
going to mess up the address but you know the location I'm talking about I do yes so there there are a couple
1:21:47
properties along the fish creek that we um that are vacant that would make good
1:21:53
park space um we actually had a conver Lee and I had a conversation with Sergey from the CAC last week about that um and
1:22:02
and again if there's a willing seller that could be on the list we we floated some years ago to the owner of two
1:22:09
Parcels that are right along the creek that would make a nice little pocket park um that um we would be interested
1:22:15
in having a conversation about that if they ever got to the point where they might want to
1:22:22
sell or donate we love donations yeah but I I you know I think
1:22:29
that one's even longer term right because there's a lot of things we don't control there um but it's appropriate to
1:22:36
sit on the list right um because I this section is aspirational as you know
1:22:43
George said uh it doesn't have to be things we absolutely can always get to
1:22:48
um you know some of the ones we will definitely get to the Ty Bridge The Bridge Street Bridge um you know we will
1:22:54
get to them but they've been on hold for a while because we've got you know a lot of other things and it can wait a little
1:23:01
while no but I mean I'm just repeating what others have said but I think having this list here that the public can view
1:23:08
and we can view even though we know it might be a decade off for some of these projects I think it's helpful as George
1:23:14
said so people know that we're even thinking about it I think we we were we were we were
1:23:20
actually thinking in terms of a five-year timeline I mean there are things that aren't on here that are also
1:23:29
in you know in our thoughts um so again this wasn't completely comprehensive so
1:23:36
yeah I mean should we put a parameter of five years as opposed to 50
1:23:42
years that so I I would just point to the example of the central fire station
1:23:48
um I in this back section for about 20 years right and then suddenly it moved
1:23:55
forward right and so you know it's hard because it's it's not it's not you know
1:24:02
easily Made Concrete this is a this is a back of the envelope list in some ways
1:24:08
and some of them will move forward and develop um you know some of them may be easy I think Bridge Street Bridge may
1:24:15
not be a difficult one don't know yet but we have to get you know eventually turn some Focus to it and see what's
1:24:22
entailed to know how big is it is it bigger than a bread box or not we don't even know some of those questions so
1:24:28
it's very preliminary but I I think it's still useful and I think this is where the council's kind of policy and
1:24:34
prioritization I think makes a difference yeah Le I kind of was interested in shifting us to that
1:24:40
conversation it does feel like there are things on this list that you know the Route 52 Access Road yes and also that
1:24:47
depends on other things so it's hard to say right now that we should prioritize that whereas things like the bridges um
1:24:53
even the sidewalk walk and bicycle Master plans communication plans that are things that we might be able to at
1:24:59
least put some more meat on the bone this year as opposed to things that they might be priorities but there's just
1:25:05
enough unknown that it doesn't make sense to prioritize this year so I was curiously if you already have a point of
1:25:11
view and how we can go through both the things that you've already added to this list which was already very comprehensive with things we brought up
1:25:18
today to try to tease out those items that we do want to spend money and or Council time on to kind of to to flesh
1:25:25
out a bit more yeah you know I think um Molly you mentioned one area in again Chris I'm
1:25:32
I'm interested in your opinion he he and I haven't compared notes and know exactly what you know each is going to
1:25:37
say but I think we should be able to kind of think about teeing up a study
1:25:43
you know periodically right you know one a year something like that and Council
1:25:49
asked for you know the traffic one on a 25 M hour speed limit took us a year we
1:25:54
teed it up let's go do it if we want to tee up another one pick the one you know
1:25:59
that we want to tee up and then we can get started because you have to Define what it is define whether you need a
1:26:05
consultant what kind you need you know scope the approximate price you know
1:26:10
those sorts of things so maybe there is like you know think about you know one study a year or something like that
1:26:17
separate from the capital projects I think my uh where I start to
1:26:23
have a little bit of a hard time thing one is that my understanding of what we
1:26:28
want out of a sidewalk plan slike plan SL Mobility plan is actually a
1:26:35
comprehensive view of those different streams and modes of transportation um and so I I would put
1:26:43
that comprehensive view at the top of the list but I recognize that makes the study and the need larger and maybe
1:26:51
extends the timeline when it becomes feasible to do well I think the tradeoff too and Molly and I and and Lee and I
1:26:58
have had separate conversations about this is when when you do a study it it's
1:27:03
really good to understand what are you what are you looking for specifically what are the outcomes you want and make
1:27:11
it make it um specific if we did a sidewalk study you know what the outcome
1:27:18
would be it would be a prioritization of where you spend your sidewalk dollars um
1:27:23
the the Mobility plan if you just hand a IL defined Mobility plan to um a
1:27:30
consultant um it it's great for the consultant because they just bill and Bill and Bill and they they you know put
1:27:37
all this stuff together that probably already exists for instance like we just did a study of the bus service in the
1:27:42
county so you have all that stuff we have done analyses in the past of sidewalks they would compile all that
1:27:50
and they would unless you define them really well they you'll end up spending a lot of money for a a study that really
1:27:57
doesn't provide for implementation um this the studies I I
1:28:02
can't tell you how many studies we have on our shelves and and formerly I had at olster County when I was um deputy
1:28:09
director of planning that never got implemented um and and so what I I would
1:28:15
suggest is you break it down into the pieces and you could have them form a larger study but then you know
1:28:22
exactly again you work with a consultant you see if you're getting a good product from them if you are and they have the
1:28:28
expertise to go on from you know a sidewalk to a bike um other other things
1:28:34
in the studies are like accessibility for persons with disabilities we should be looking at that as well um you know
1:28:41
so again you might you want to you want to Define these pretty well like a a communication
1:28:48
study I think you need to Define your goals and what outcomes you're looking for and then we can figure out is this
1:28:54
something we can do inous is this something we have a consultant for how big a project is it yeah yeah I mean the
1:29:02
outcome from these studies would be how do we prioritize and how do we queue up
1:29:09
in priority order the specific projects like which sidewalks where which bike Lanes where do we need that bike lane
1:29:16
before we need the sidewalk over year to me the sidewalk one is would be a valuable one CU we're Mak we're having
1:29:22
this conversation every year about what sidewalks we should do with cdbg they ask what's the public process that you
1:29:29
had we do a hearing um and and I would like somebody to take a look at it to
1:29:34
see where there are gaps um that that could be readily filled that would then
1:29:40
complete the sidewalk system I look at Churchill Street and I I think wow that that really should have a sidewalk and
1:29:46
we should be taking those tracks out and redoing the geometry of that road so it's safe um and that's you know again
1:29:54
that's a conversation with Metro North we don't control those tracks so one of the ones that the Main Street
1:30:01
access committee came up with absolutely both both of the intersections there but
1:30:06
but again like sidewalks um the turnaround on some of these grants is just so short um I I
1:30:14
would love to have a plan where we know the next 10 sidewalk projects we or we have a GIS system that that rates um
1:30:23
different segments of sidewalk on their condition on their Ada compatibility on
1:30:29
on whether or not there's missing pieces that we could just fix um
1:30:37
so can I ask a clarifying question in terms of one study a year is that one
1:30:43
study for all of these projects or are some of them different enough that we
1:30:49
could if funding allowed do more than one study I'm I'm sort of unclear on on
1:30:56
if the one study is just one of these things it it really depends I it depends
1:31:01
if you're doing it you know in-house or consultant I mean a lot of these Natalie
1:31:07
could work on like I'm sure Natalie could put together the sidewalk
1:31:13
study the reality is the Fishkill Avenue Corridor committee was supposed to take
1:31:19
six or 12 months and we're now in year two of it with no end in sight so her
1:31:24
time and the money to pay her we we've we've really gone over budget so again
1:31:30
part of this is we can get to where we want over time but you can't do it all
1:31:36
at once you you you have to kind of space it out so that we um you know
1:31:42
don't break the bank we are the bank no let not break ourselves break us
1:31:49
yes um to that to that specific example Chris um where one of these projects
1:31:56
could be taken on by Natalie but we've exceeded her budget um as it exists in one part of the budget could we be using
1:32:04
part of that 75,000 that we hypothetically set aside um for her to
1:32:09
take on additional project or is it about her time capacity how many hours she has in a day I I think the answer to
1:32:16
that is you could and and it just depends on what her availability is um
1:32:21
because she she's also Staffing um our planning board which has Again Jennifer
1:32:27
might be able to talk about how how busy they are but it it kind of fluctuates as I understand and some some months she's
1:32:35
all her hours are on that similarly with legal like you know when we a lot of
1:32:41
these things involve our our city attorneys and they're also off this
1:32:48
sheet working on lawsuits that we're dealing with with insurance and and other things that are mundane like
1:32:55
contracts and and we only have them so many hours we only have so much
1:33:00
availability so what we try to do is is figure out how much we want to fit in as much as we can and we really have um as
1:33:08
we get done with some of these Legacy projects multiple parts of our organization will be freed up like we'll
1:33:15
be really relieved when Fishkill teller Avenue is done at the end of this year um and that's taken a lot from our
1:33:22
our attorney or city engineer finance my time on water actually because they have
1:33:30
to locate a lot of the
1:33:37
utilities okay other
1:33:43
thoughts um I did want to clarify around um I I think this is covered under item
1:33:51
51 of housing zones um is this where our conversation about
1:33:57
inclusionary zoning and um the potential for multi family zoning in that whole
1:34:02
conversation we had two weeks ago lives yes yes great just want to make sure it
1:34:09
was here somewhere yep and see I I think you know we can
1:34:14
get to I think this year we might be able to do some of the things on that
1:34:19
housing list I mean you know um n put a a memo last summer I had one a couple
1:34:26
years back had pretty much similar things um I think we can tackle some of those some of it's our own you know
1:34:32
discipline of let's get to it and let's not wait for you know every piece of evidence to appear so that we can decide
1:34:40
just use our judgment and make decisions based on people we trust you know telling us what the answers are right
1:34:47
but yeah all right any other
1:34:54
comments I'm just kind of curious what next steps are from here to come up with
1:35:00
the ones that we might want to prioritize like to give an example for for a project that kicks off either this
1:35:05
year a planning study that kicks off either this year or next year can I can I suggest that you um dig
1:35:13
down into your mobility and communication plans and try to figure out what what are your goals what do you
1:35:19
want to look at um what are the outputs you're looking for then we can start to figure out how we resource
1:35:27
that yeah I think that it would be great to continue that conversation here and
1:35:32
agree that we need to clarify that before we ask for um any hard things to be done um I know Amber alluded to
1:35:39
having some ideas about Communications strategy in particular okay um and I
1:35:46
would suggest simply that we have this on the agenda in two weeks again to keep the conversation going particularly
1:35:53
around those two topics I was going to ask for so you're saying those two topics or broader the
1:35:58
whole list of priorities you're saying those two topics in particular um that seems like where
1:36:04
we're headed for in terms of next steps but I'm open you know to other no I think it's great and then my point was
1:36:10
going to be that this convers I really appreciate this and let me express my gratitude that we're having this conversation around priorities but I
1:36:15
think having a heads up about what's coming down the pike for conversations is really important so that we can prepare do some background homework and
1:36:21
just have more pointed effective efficient conversations so I'm really Keen for
1:36:27
that yeah Jeff you know you you raised that with me and you know um Council we
1:36:34
sort of an informal process but occasionally we talked about just having a list of what are we trying to work on
1:36:40
in the next few workshops um and I I think that's a fair approach it's been informal you know it comes and goes um
1:36:47
we can try it again or we can talk at the end of each meeting or what are we trying to get to next what are we trying to get to that's been on the table a
1:36:54
while right yeah I'm still keen on exploring maybe formalizing it a bit more you know
1:37:00
within the confines of what exist so we'll I'll continue to explore that in conversation all right and we may
1:37:07
propose something too to make it easier could we informally just to start
1:37:12
piloting that direction hear um from you Lee what you expect to um be queuing up
1:37:19
onto the agenda over the next let's say two workshops
1:37:26
some of that yes some of that no and as you know a lot of it is you know depends on what comes up a hiring uh a contract
1:37:33
or whatever but um in terms of a longer list like what are we working on this
1:37:38
year obviously zonings on our list right um the fish kill Avenue rex that we said
1:37:44
we do the preliminary and then if they come along further we'll do more um
1:37:50
let's you know uh we can do it we have a couple items that um Bruce flow put
1:37:57
together before he left um he had a resoning of um One East Main that we're
1:38:03
going to be bringing next Workshop uh because it doesn't make sense that it's light industrial it's like you literally
1:38:10
can't have tracks there you're not supposed to anyway um and also um we
1:38:16
were looking at what fees the council might consider waving for adus if we get
1:38:22
the Adu program we had a conversation previously that we didn't want those Monies to be wasted on
1:38:29
um a bureaucratic process and that maybe we could um make that easier um so so
1:38:36
again I had Bruce put together memos on both topics that we'll be bringing at the next Workshop okay that' be
1:38:47
good and and we will hopefully be bringing a building inspector to you at some point um first in executive session
1:38:54
to meet and then we'll bring them public the person publicly great great and I think uh I
1:39:02
had a question too what pulma brought up about our larger affordable housing discussion it sounds like that was
1:39:07
actually already part of it that was mentioned there the part about adus so we might be able to move forward on that and Lee I think you said that because
1:39:15
Natalie's time and our legal time is currently going towards the immediate fish gill zoning uh think changes we
1:39:22
want to make that what kind wait to finish that discussion up at least they have capacity to then move back to
1:39:28
affordable housing kind of the last time that list to kind of requests and questions that the council had for them we met two weeks ago am I understanding
1:39:35
those next steps Loosely correctly yeah we do need to space it out a little
1:39:41
right it doesn't mean we can't accelerate a little as well but um you know Natalie is not a full-time planner
1:39:47
she has other uh things that she works on and and we have budgets as Chris said
1:39:52
so yeah a little bit like that great thank
1:39:58
you all right any other comments Lee no this was great I I appreciate
1:40:05
everybody's you know kind of um listening through it and the ideas and and again as you know it's it's a little
1:40:13
uncertain we're trying to figure out how to get to this but I I think this is an improvement so we can keep doing
1:40:18
something like it we can put something shortterm on the you know Workshop kind of short-term agenda as well as this
1:40:24
longer term and and I I would just say there's other things that are moving along that
1:40:30
aren't on this that we're getting grants for I would just throw out quickly EV charging stations making our Fleet
1:40:37
Greener we're in the process right now of buying two more electric vehicles um
1:40:43
we're ramping up our tree program for the spring last year we got um 38 trees
1:40:49
planted by homeowners by by doing a wholesale purchase that saved a lot of money in delivering it so so understand
1:40:56
this isn't comprehensive we if you have smaller things you want to talk to me about don't hesitate um because as I can
1:41:04
fit them in I will try um but again sometimes I I have to say well I can't
1:41:09
get to it this year but we'll think about
1:41:16
it okay all right so um next meeting is next Tuesday
1:41:27
February 18th at 7:00 that'll be a city council meeting where there will be
1:41:34
public comment and and the mayor will be doing his state of the
1:41:39
city address okay you think I'm gonna be done well I just put it out there Lee so
1:41:45
you better finish it now right public space now all right yeah all right on
1:41:51
the flight home all right and we don't have to adjourn this meeting so right you yeah you need a
1:41:57
motion to adjourn I think how about a motion to adjourn motion second all right all in favor I I I
1:42:06
I thank you thank you all right that was good
