DNA now we have I know we have a lot of cold cases in our police

cold cases and the matter of fact they're using it on right now as we speak 28 years on the John Bonet Ramsey
4:59
casing in Colorado that hasn't been solved yet at one time there was 887 suspects
5:05
in that case it's it's dwindling down now they're they're eliminating and
5:11
through this genetic genealogy so they're narrowing it down

also want to acknowledge the inauguration of President Trump yesterday and I've had a couple of my
8:20
residents reach out with concerns about some of the things that he's already put into action or talked about putting into
8:26
action and there's a lot right now and I know people are feeling a lot of different things in a lot of different ways and so I just encourage you to
8:33
continue to as already been spoken here by Dennis and by Justice to reach out to your community and talk to people and I
8:38
know there are people too who are feeling seen for the first time in a while and so I appreciate our community is feeling lots of different ways about
8:45
this election and I hope as Dennis said that we continue to find ways to pull together and I'll pass it to
8:51
Jeff thanks Molly um it was in the news that the governor of New York had a
8:57
State of the State address there was a lot of of interesting things in there but the one that I would point out just for sharing with the council for our
9:03
consideration was an interesting uh initiative U with which has some new uh
9:08
components to it and some extensions of components it's focused on uh promoting kids mental and physical health it's
9:14
called the unplug andplay initiative and I just want to point out that there is funding that's going to be brought online to support more Community
9:22
Community Resources community centers and other infrastructure for supporting connections within communities which I
9:28
think we'll definitely be keeping eye on for opportunities there as well as um competitive grant funding for the
9:34
expansion of playgrounds construction and expansion of playgrounds which I know we've been discussing recently as
9:39
an opportunity um it's it's you know initiative that speaks to my heart about the idea of getting away from online
9:46
it's the unplugged component of it the social media aspect it's a theme we've been talking about a lot it's
9:51
encouraging people to come down to be part of the conversations to be part of groups and meetings within the community
9:58
I'll say that um we just pass um Martin Luther King Day of Service recognitions and it was beautiful magnificent to see
10:04
the amount of volunteering that I observed um I myself volunteered over at the um the habitat the greater Newberg
10:10
Habitat for Humanity on the weekend and it is uh just something to really encourage that we have more connection
10:16
within our communities more conversations with our communities and turn away from social media for these
10:21
these conversations so I'll pass it over to Amber all right um I think the mayor is
10:28
going to touch on this a little bit more so I'm only going to very briefly say that if you were not able to make the uh
10:34
public hearing for the Fior Trail which I was not able to you can still submit comments online until March 4th I'm very
10:40
much looking forward to submitting my comments in support of the Fior trail and I encourage our neighbors to make
10:45
their voices heard and um I very briefly wanted to uh acknowledge something that
10:52
also happened yesterday it was the death of Cecil Richards and Cecil was a Trailblazer for Reproductive Justice I
10:58
admire her um I had the the honor of meeting her very briefly um I'm
11:04
certainly saddened by her loss especially as this would have been the 55th anniversary of Row versus Wade in a
11:10
day or two and uh so I look forward to carrying forth um the torch of service
11:16
to our community and hope that others do the same and just want to take a moment to acknowledge her that's all thank
11:24
you thank you
11:32
thank you Amber um I was saddened to learn of her passing as well um I have a few things to share um

14:28
report um um I just wanted to you know it's been 24 hours since the snowstorm
14:35
and even as I drove here there are sidewalks that aren't clear which with these temperatures is going to be very
14:42
difficult to be cleared um if you see a sidewalk that's not clear please report
14:48
it to the city um and they can work with someone to to get that snow removed
14:57
especially it's difficult for children walking to school in the morning and
15:02
anyone walking on any sidewalk right now that isn't cleared is dangerous and
15:08
um really it's best to clear it within 24 hours um thank you Molly for
15:14
commenting on uh this the warming centers um through the county and that
15:21
is all I have today uh good evening I'll be quick as
15:27
well as I've only been councilman for a week now so um but I am honored I would
15:32
like to say I'm honored and excited to return uh to this position and I look forward to all the challenges and
15:40
opportunities uh we Face specifically uh fish kill Avenue res zoning MTA
15:45
development and the ongoing discussions regarding affordability um so I look forward to
15:52

15:59
um projects and Zoning um and I would like to say that anyone in Ward 4 would
16:05
like to get in touch with me please do so via my email or and or phone number which can be found on the city of Beacon
16:13
website and that's all thank you great thank you all um I appreciate
16:19
the commentary about resources at the county level you know they have their own health department they have a family
16:24
community services department um they have a Human Rights Commission and they're well funded um and I I do think
16:31
it's um they offer some great resources I've asked um some of them to come talk to us uh and we'll see about scheduling
16:38
some of that so that's the first um second I just want to um you know thank
16:43
the council for uh allowing me to attend a funeral last week it was a a mentor from my days as a consultant at the
16:49
Boston Consulting Group and uh you know just reminds me that um don't forget to
16:56
spend time with people that uh matter in your life cuz uh it's short um then the
17:03
stage one drought emergency is uh off the table I just wanted to let everyone know that uh for those that haven't
17:09
heard that Beacon is required to declare uh a drought emergency if our three
17:16
reservoirs collectively go beneath a certain percentage of capacity that doesn't count the fact that we also have
17:23
three Wells from which we derive much of our water so we're never really in
17:28
drought Emer in terms of the risk um but we do have to declare it when our dams
17:33
go go below certain um percentage fill in the reservoirs we're back up above that and so we can declare that stage
17:40
one drought emergency lifted as of January 15th um the last thing I just
17:45
want to talk about and Amber referenced it is I had the opportunity to um offer
17:52
uh comments at the hearing for the fur trail that was held by the um state of
17:57
New York and while my full com comments I won't read I will read to you a few
18:02
key paragraphs and sentences so uh in that and I had the opportunity to go
18:07
first so I hope I set the tone uh it was pretty good set of hearings I heard the first half but not the latter half of
18:14
them uh but allow me to offer my enthusiastic uh unqualified support and
18:20
I I'll put on my prop now for the proposed Hudson Highlands F Trail which will take a heavily used trail head
18:27
desperately in need of improvement and transform it and a 7 and 1/2 Mile Stretch on the Hudson River into a
18:33
beautiful and unique linear Park linking Beacon and kle spring and eventually
18:38
hopefully connecting to the Future Beacon Hopewell rail trail and the 750
18:44
mile Empire estate Trail um again I won't go through the entire testimony but I I do want to point out a couple of
18:50
things the city of Beacon is already partnering with the Hudson Highlands fur Trail Inc and is looking for additional
18:57
ways to work together we are negotiating with them to build its maintenance facility for the fure trail adjacent to
19:03
the trail at the city's wastewater treatment plant the city was excited when the fur Trail moved forward its
19:10
proposed timetable for construction in Beacon and we encouraged them to build
19:15
sooner um to build their trail head restrooms which would be adjacent to our train station uh the connection to the
19:22
Future Beacon Hopewell rail trail and the pedestrian bridge over fish Fishkill Creek another major benefit for Beacon
19:28
is that the fur Trail will connect it's an amazing set of connections Dennings Point State Park Madam Brett Park our
19:35
future rail trail the Claris sour Trail long do Park seagar Riverfront Park and
19:42
our train station so the connections are um uh multiple and it will add to our
19:50
ability to maintain a very long Main Street for those of you who've been here long enough our main street was the
19:55
result of two Villages coming together a century ago its length um was part of
20:01
the reason it fell into a deep decline in the 70s and we need the tourism to
20:06
make it work uh and I think this will be an important part of it and then finally I'll just add that a critical benefit
20:12
for the city as well as the fur Trail is that it will serve as a catalyst for the building of a rail trail on the
20:18
abandoned Beacon Hopewell rail spur that's running from our Beacon train station and along our Main Street this
20:25
future rail trail will connect the heart of Beacon to Dutchess County trails to the walkway over the Hudson down to Cold
20:32
Spring and then to New York's Empire trait you know State trail that runs all the way to Buffalo and Canada so I just
20:39
wanted to add that uh my full comments are available on the website but I just wanted to add that part um and that's
20:45
all I got Chris um just a reminder that when we
20:53
have snow of more than 2 in um you have to remove your cars from the roadways uh
21:00
between 9900 p.m. and 7: a.m. unfortunately over the weekend we issued quite a number of tickets because there
21:06
were a number of streets we couldn't even get plows down um if in the case if
21:12
that happens again some of those cars may be towed I don't believe we towed any but we did Issue uh quite a quite a
21:19
number of tickets so if we have more than two Ines please take your cars put them in the public parking lots um once
21:26
the roads are cleared then you can come back out the street and um thank you for cooperating a lot of people know this
21:33
already and um I think it's just a small number we have to keep reminding each year Chris can you confirm is that 900
21:40
p.m. after it has stopped snowing or if it's still snowing at 900
21:45
p.m. the code says after any fall or accumulation of snow of two or more
21:51
inches between the hours of 9 and 7 so I would say if you have had 2 in before or
21:58
during during that time frame that's yes that's when it counts thank you so if it starts at 7:00 a.m. you have a little
22:03
bit more time but but under no condition are you supposed to block a road from
22:09
being plowed and in some cases like Cliff Street we had people on both sides we there's no way we could have gotten
22:14
app plow down that without moving cars thanks
22:20
okay um all right so let's start up we have two appointments I'm going to go
22:25
through both appointments and then we'll swear them in so the first one is appointing Derek Sherman to the position

31:12
that is correct mayor okay tax jurisdiction in New York state is permitted to Grant exemptions to its
31:19
senior citizens age 65 or older to allow them to receive a certain percentage
31:25
exemption for the real property assessment on a slight scale from 0 to 50% this local law would make the city's
31:34
tax exemption monetary amounts consistent with the county and increase it from the current range of $20,500 to
31:43
a maximum income of 26,200 up to $50,000 so it's providing
31:49
this uh to more people to be eligible okay so I could hear that
31:55
thanks Pete um is it on is it on his end or is it on
32:01
our end it might be on his end because I loud I made it Ben can you say something just to see if you're coming through
32:07
please yes um he's coming through fine on my end you're low too so I think it's
32:13
on this end Pete but I I did hear the City attorney he B he basically said we
32:19
are raising so there's a a maximum income for a senior to get that uh
32:26
exemption uh from their partial partial exemption of their assessment and their
32:31
tax and we're raising it up to the county number that's currently used can we have Nick say something to test oh
32:39
yep that is correct you he that sounds worse it's very loud now we hear you
32:45
just say test so we can get you at the right volume please test keep going Nick
32:53
test test test I I think it's fine it's fine okay good
33:00
good enough thank you all right so very the mayor described it correctly okay
33:07
that's too loud so this is simply setting a public hearing for this proposed local law and it's for the
33:14
first meeting in February which would be two weeks from yesterday uh all in favor
33:19
of setting that public hearing for this local was say I I and anyone opposed
33:24
okay so the second one is actually it's companion it is also setting a public hearing for the same date this is
33:31
concerning tax exemptions with for disabled people with limited income uh can I get a motion to set that public
33:37
hearing motion second so that's Molly and Amber and Nick you'll tell us that this is doing the same
33:44
thing correct mayor I'll speak softly now that is doing the same thing correct got it good okay um um just a I guess
33:53
maybe a procedural question for when we have the public hearing so I think we talked last week because
33:58
it looks like these are part of the same code for us that we could combine them when we have the public hearing is that
34:04
our still our plan so our advice is they need to be noticed as two separate
34:10
hearings but you could open them and hear them together okay okay great let's
34:16
do that uh and the third it the item after that is also setting a public hearing and this is for the 2025
34:23
Community Development block grant program can I get a motion in a second to set the hearing motion second so that
34:30
was Paloma and Molly and Chris will you give us any details we need for that um the city is part of the County's uh cdbg
34:37
Consortium and each year they have an application round they announce this um
34:42
in mid December and we have kind of a tight turnaround to do our application
34:48
our letter of intent and part of the process is that we have to hold a public hearing uh so we'll be taking feedback
34:54
from residents about possible projects um the timeline really isn't realistic
35:01
for ACT taking action on anything that's brought this year but that could be for
35:06
next year um and these tight turnarounds we're we're struggling just to get the
35:11
estimated uh cost for the sidewalk that we're proposing to do on Walcott Avenue
35:17
and then these these proposals need to be in a certain area of the city and that map was available on The Duchess
35:24
County website right that's right and there's a catchment area of low and where there's a density of low and
35:30
moderate income residents um it's generally around the area where we've done work before on South Avenue um it
35:37
does extend out Fishkill Avenue and and we can put that map on our website um we
35:43
can actually upload that for the um the hearing that would be really helpful I think thanks Chris okay okay uh any
35:51
other discussion on this item all right so um all those in favor of setting the public hearing for the C cdbg grant
35:58
program uh say I I I anyone opposed did we vote on resolution

36:10

evening wish I could have been there in person but I'm still in another meeting on the other side of town I would like
37:11
to say kudos to everybody that got new appointments and reappointments approved
37:16
in tonight's meeting it's a big commitment and
37:21
responsibility to represent this blind City I would also like like to
37:28
say that I really appreciated the direction that last week's Workshop
37:34
meeting went and hopefully it was captured by all as I don't believe most of it was captured on the video I'm
37:42
grateful to see that council members were willing to speak up and speak out loud for asking for Real Change
37:49
especially on the fishup avenue Route 52 I still believe it's time for a
37:55
change this city must update its current Charter and comprehensive it will be too late to
38:01
change anything once new large construction projects are put into position and built out anyone following
38:09
the West End Loft project in Newberg knows that this could be duplicated on our Majestic Waterfront and this should
38:16
never be for the record I also attended and spoke out during the fge trails New
38:22
York State draft generic environmental impact public hearing review ring only
38:28
60% of the plan submitted to date not everyone in the city and the surrounding
38:33
communities are in favor of the current iteration of their plans even the rivere
38:39
keeper has taken a stance daating many potential Public Safety and environmental concerns let's not be
38:46
fooled by the mega monies being thrown at this project by the Fior Trail and some private entities stay
