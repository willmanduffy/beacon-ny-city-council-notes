0:12
ready to go we're ready straight uh good evening uh and welcome
0:19
to the Wednesday February 19th 2025 meeting of the city of Beacon zoning
0:25
board of appeals my name is Jordan H I am the chair of this board I'd like to
0:30
welcome my fellow board members our attorney George our uh zoning board and
0:36
everything secretary Mercedes uh our new uh acting uh building inspector welcome
0:44
um and we will be uh holding a public hearing on one item uh this evening uh
0:50
and then uh some some miscellaneous business uh to cover um I don't have my
0:56
normal uh intro that montos normally brings me to to read read off of uh so I will say um the uh our purpose uh is to
1:05
Grant uh relief from the zoning code uh and the uh things that we can consider
1:12
are five factors um and those five factors uh are as to whether an undesirable change will be produced in
1:19
the character uh of the neighborhood or detriment to the nearby properties will be created by the granting of the
1:25
variants uh as to whether the benefit the applicant can seek uh can be achieved through another feasible method
1:33
that the applicant can pursue as to whether the requested variance is substantial as to whether the proposed
1:40
variance will have an adverse effect or impact on the physical or environmental
1:46
conditions in the neighborhood or District as to whether uh the alleged difficulty is self-created and then uh
1:53
by law we must Grant the minimum variance necessary and adequate to preserve and protect the character uh of
2:00
the neighborhood and health safety and Welfare of the community um so it would be helpful for those U applicants uh and
2:09
also for the public to um attempt to limit their persuasiveness uh to us to
2:15
those factors as those are the factors that we can consider uh on this board um
2:21
what will the order of operations are we will open up uh the public hearing uh
2:26
for for each agenda item tonight really one we'll do miscellaneous business at the end uh and then the applicant will
2:33
come up uh to the microphone if you state your name uh and address for the record uh present your application uh
2:40
will'll probably be some back and forth questions um from the board uh we'll
2:46
then open it up to the public um if anyone from the public wishes to speak on uh a public hearing item uh they
2:53
would also come up to the uh Podium State their name and address for the record uh and again if you speak to
2:59
those um those five factors uh that would be great and then we will close the public
3:06
hearing uh have a uh a nice heated discussion amongst ourselves and and
3:12
vote one way or the other um it doesn't have to be heated it's fun when it is um
3:19
all right uh so that is that um and uh
3:24
George I just for some clarity I think I think um
3:30
can you just explain uh on agenda item number one before I open the public hearing um the first of the two
3:38
variances uh the first of the two variance requests yeah so this is for um
3:44
this is for six Cliff Street um and Corey can obviously chime in if I get
3:50
anything wrong but basically what it is is there are two area variances required
3:56
one is for the minimum lot area per dwelling unit in that te District
4:03
because the proposed addition on the second floor of this home is for the purpose of making it a two family home
4:10
it's currently a one family two family homes are permitted uses there so we're not reviewing the use it's just um
4:16
because it's a two family I think it's 2500 square ft per dwelling unit um which as a one family it satisfies but
4:23
once it's two you have to do the division so what it comes out to is the proposed Min the proposed lot area per
4:30
dwelling unit would be 1631 as a two family 2 200 is required so the the
4:36
variance is for that minimum lot area per dwelling unit so that's what it is
4:42
there's no it's not like a setback it's just you know conforming with the the
4:48
size of the property taking into account the constraints of the size of the property so that so just just to repeat
4:54
what I think you said back to us just so we're all clear so two families are allowed in this Zone mhm but if you if
5:01
you have a two family uh in this Zone each unit must be 2500 ft or the total
5:09
must be 2500 ft each the lot area per dwelling unit is 2500 sare ft and and
5:17
just defining lot area is what it's the entire area of the so what you would do
5:22
is you would take the area of the lot you know what yeah and divide it by two so in the perfect world if it's a 5,000
5:29
ft lot you divide it by two and you get the 2500 and you're good the idea I guess is you don't want basically more
5:37
lot more dwelling unit per percentage of lot right um this is a smaller lot so I
5:44
think that's really where the constraint comes from as a one family as a yeah as a single family building wouldn't be an
5:52
issue but because it's two family there's that bit of a uh variance so
5:57
it's not it's not a percentage then right so it's if if this was uh no it's not a it's not a 50% of the lot you know
6:05
it's not that kind of thing um it's just in the code it's actually in this section the the required square foot and
6:13
Corey correct me if I'm wrong is it you look at the zoning District next to it
6:19
right something like that to figure out what the math is it's like one half of the the the zoning District next to it
6:24
so it's not a percentage it's not that it has to be 30% or whatever of the lot
6:30
area it's just straight up 2500 square feet per dwelling unit that's required yeah it is required
6:37
yeah it's it's it's all predetermined but you know that's kind of like the code tells us exactly what the
6:43
measurement is um the only reason I'm chiming in is because I realized as I'm reading my own letter to to mitigate
6:49
maybe some confusion is just to really recognize that we're talking about uh a variance for 869 ft it's actually double
6:56
that amount because it's per dwelling So reading you know if you just keep reading You' think it was just an 869 ft
7:03
um variance but Tech it's not two variances it's just the amount is times two that just isn't reflected in there
7:09
2500 square ft of lot per unit yes that's what you that's what you
7:16
need so that's a a city's great way of of determining how much you can do on a lot given its size so if you turn that
7:22
around it says that you have to have a 5,000 ft lot to have two units yes and
7:29
not District I just chose to write it this way so you could see individually
7:35
because it's per dwelling in it as the language of the code reads but the way you're thinking about it big picture is
7:40
really the way to go so you can see but the funny thing is that neighborhood doesn't have very many 5,000 foot lots
7:46
and the VAR the the zoning regulations allow two family units that's most which
7:54
is kind of they at Cross purpose that's one way to not allow them yeah
8:01
that's a lot intention was not to allow them is to make them legal but make them legal in a way that nobody can actually
8:08
well make them make them legal and then have them come to us I suppose yeah so again the the use is not we're not
8:14
focusing on the use tonight it's it's this square foot per dwelling unit and it's really a a victim of circumstance
8:22
that the lot is small right so um I believe the addition is just the second
8:28
floor exists it's just slight addition to the back of the second floor so it's not like a whole new second floor and
8:33
the applicant can obviously go through it but there's not a second floor being built it's a partial addition on the
8:39
second floor for the purpose of making it to family all right right and before
8:44
it was a now it is a single family so it doesn't run into this new constraints exactly exactly okay so it's like
8:52
1,700 square feet two two two few square feet 1631 yeah 1631 you got there it's
9:01
on page one of the architect anyway any any other pre pre questions all right uh
9:06
can I have a motion to open the public hearing on agenda item number one motion by Monto have second second second by so
9:12
all in favor
9:18
I uh you looked very eager U my name is David Freeman I am
9:24
the architect for the owner so um it is two variance requests they are kind of
9:29
separate um so I just want to go through the the two family one first and then we'll go to the variants for the back
9:36
second they are the owners are actually um they own a construction firm they're
9:41
doing a lot of work in Beacon they do want to relocate themselves to Beacon wherever they are they like the city
9:46
they bought this piece of property literally for the view from the second floor of Mount Beacon so however they
9:53
should have checked better um they bought it with the understanding that was an accessory apartment already um I
10:00
walked in and said no it's not and checked with Bruce flowers and he says you're right Dave no it's not so the
10:05
intent here is to legalize that to make it into a second floor um it's a 35%
10:12
variance when you come down to it so it's to me not a large variance as you
10:17
said all the lots are undersized um it is a smaller lot we're not going to grow
10:24
the lot size so it's about 35 it's a 35% variance there are two two driveways
10:30
there are two curb Cuts there is a garage on the leftand side of the house so we do have adequate parking for it um
10:37
we're not changing the front of the house we are not proposing to change the back of the house right now the addition
10:43
is to address literally as you said to make it into a proper two family so the
10:50
front the lower level would be entered on the right hand side in the back the upper level would be entered through the
10:56
front door the owner proposes obviously with a renovation to change the windows
11:01
fix the front porch um make it a little safer I think that's about it for the
11:07
two family is it going to be owner occupied um not that it matters to you
11:12
but yes it is so matter to me I know so that's the intent the owner like I said
11:17
they live down in Rockland County right now they do do work here um if you notice on the plans there is a large set
11:24
of Windows we're proposing on the back section um to look out onto it on to
11:29
mount Beacon they love it so um their son may move into the second floor first
11:35
floor but that's you know that's not can't be part of the variant essentially so the intent is for them to live on the
11:41
second floor so the second variance is for rear yard variants um as the attorney
11:48
discussed right now it's placing a second floor on top of the back section of the house um extending the addition 6
11:56
ft and then the second part of the request is to put a 6ft deck on so right now the back section of the house is 12x
12:03
20 um it's not a great living space cuz that's really going to be the two story buing space so put in a 6ot addition
12:11
across the back um and on the second at a second floor get an 18t by 20t room
12:18
that puts us 12 ft from the backyard and then put a deck on the back which gets us 6 ft from the backyard so that's the
12:24
request for the second per variance it could probably be done with a patio
12:29
if if the board has discussion um but a deck gets a rail and a rail says to the
12:37
neighbors to the bar in the back and everybody else please don't come up on my backyard so that's kind of the
12:45
intent the addition it's going to be a twostory
12:50
addition on the back correct yes and how deep how far does it it's 18 ft wide if
12:58
you look on the third or fourth floor on the plan if you go to the
13:05
back so right now the um right now the first floor is 12 ft deep mhm we're
13:10
going to extend the first floor 6 ft and then put a second floor on the entire part of it that's that's the propos so
13:16
there currently isn't a second floor over that no okay so like I said that's
13:22
where the view is so and then replicate both floors so kitchen living area is back there for
13:28
both Apartments
13:34
and that's all I got um you know is it self-created yeah
13:40
they'd like to live here is it an undersized lot yes not at the time the
13:46
house was built in 1900 it's basically unchanged since 1900 you can tell as an
13:51
architect um you know it's it's not that different the sidey
13:58
yards are actually pretty good so that's that's the good part of it to me is that the side yards are actually fairly good
14:04
sized back from the neighboring properties um so we're not
14:11
encroaching so are you proposing a roof deck roof roof deck if if you can't get the
14:19
deck deck the back deck we're proposing both right now you want both I in an
14:25
Ideal World well yeah the the the deck is for the people in the first floor and right roof decks for the people in the
14:31
second Flor the roof deck is only accessible from the second floor so so there Reas no on the second no and
14:39
the roof deck is just towards the back of the property it's just it's just over the addition
14:52
essentially trying to stay with the character of the architecture and so what did the Neighbors say well we don't
14:58
know yeah right we may find out I don't you know the one the one towards Main
15:04
Street is um it's it's an open lot the ones across the street are Apartments um
15:10
the neighbor to the Southside um I don't know
15:18
so yeah MH you know I don't understand the uh the rules nowadays with we have a
15:26
a new minimum parking requirement but this I don't know anything about minimum parking
15:31
requirements for duplexes or how that plays I mean it looks like
15:38
they have adequate parking right but I do we hit a
15:43
limit what's the limit for duplexes nowadays it's a good question so that's
15:48
something newer I haven't had a chance to bring myself up the speed on but definitely a question that we can we can
15:54
look at get an answer um I don't know I mean personally saying there's two there's two driveways there's not
16:01
typically two driveways on most of these properties that actually does add an extra parking space that already exists
16:06
um it's almost like it's almost like it it was accounted for like they said that it was
16:13
they thought it was an accessory apartment it's almost like somebody had that thought and that was installed but there is a curb cut which means the city
16:19
was involved at one point in time but there's only three bedrooms upstairs right there's no kitchen
16:25
so and we're going to talk illegal apartment now there was a kitchen upstairs so that's there there was an
16:32
exess plant is not cor no no I'm not I you know I don't want to show that it's it was not legal um there were so there
16:40
were three bedrooms upstairs so there were three bedrooms and one of the bedrooms was a kitchen yeah one one of
16:46
the bedrooms had a little kitchenet in it I'm assuming the person who lived there use it that was their living area
16:52
they Ed the other bedroom so I I thought the parking was one one space per unit
16:59
was my understanding from previous building it just changed recently um to
17:04
reduce it drastically I believe Max so it's like I don't want to give an answer right now until I have a chance to look
17:09
at it because of that change okay um but it might work to the favor that it is a big reduction yeah like I said I thought
17:15
from two weeks ago building inspector was one per unit so yeah and uh I don't
17:21
know if it's applicable but the new the rules for adus is you have to add one
17:27
parking space for accessory dwelling unit so if you have a now the rules
17:35
would be something like maximum of three parking and but you have to add one so
17:41
it' be I guess four if you have an Adu well if you
17:47
remember last month that would be a maximum a ma a maximum of six right for
17:53
two right right I don't know I don't want to say that as as law but I remember I remember if you remember that
17:59
diagram right with the cars lined up on the right side of the property and they had six there were six cars and I think
18:05
they said they you know needed to show what the maximum was that was their MH
18:10
intent um and I think it was six but you know I don't again I don't want to say
18:16
that's the that that is what the requirement is well what is the amount of parking in the current driveways so
18:22
you could technically get two cars on each side nose detail
18:30
it sounds like a sort of happy medium really like you're not above the maximum
18:35
of six if that was what the law would require
18:41
and you'd have three in one if you use the old rules for a house and an Adu so
18:50
sounds like the parking isn't a problem I I don't think
18:56
so all right unless they decide to try to extend the driveway and put in five
19:01
parking spaces or something uh okay uh any other questions for uh the
19:09
applicant's adviser um would you consider not
19:17
putting the deck on the ground floor in the back and thus reducing if you'd like me to walk back up and consider that I
19:24
would I I would I don't like I said the nice part about a deck um it has a
19:30
railing on it and we will not get people visiting who might not be exactly sober
19:36
there are there's there's a bar right behind the house essentially um but if the board was more comfortable with just
19:42
a patio that would be
19:49
fine it's legal to put a roof on I mean a rooftop deck deck that Cory Ops on that
19:57
Cory is it is it legal to put a deck up
20:02
there another interesting question we actually were talking about this before it came up um my understanding is it is but the
20:10
question I need to research is whether it needs to go through the Architectural Review Board first because it is technically a roof structure and there
20:17
is the um the possibility of there's people on my roof can they look at my
20:22
window next door does it fit with the architectural fit of the neighborhood um
20:27
I I believe the code provides the ability for the architecture review board to uh
20:33
comment I got to look into it a little bit more but I'm leaning towards the fact that that should be looked at as
20:38
well I'm not sure if that pertains I mean it does but not so much to what we're doing here tonight
20:44
for the variances but something I think would most likely be looked at after you make your
20:53
decision well we could always approve it condition conditionally yeah
21:02
all right uh anyone from the public wish to speak on this
21:11
application um we are the neighbors great if you could state your
21:17
name and address for the record Alexandra Cabrera um I'm here on behalf of manova cabera the
21:22
homeowner sorry yeah is it better that was for the recording excellent do I have to say it again
21:29
okay Alexandra Cabrera and I'm here on behalf of manura Cabrera she is the homeowner and your address and my
21:35
grandmother and your address oh 8 Cliff Street so the the direct uh house to the
21:42
right yeah depending on which way you look at it yes sure um C is right yep to
21:49
be fair you know whoever buys their property you know we don't care what they do as long as it's everything's
21:54
fine and not disturbing us um throughout
22:00
their Endeavors of fixing apartments and also that lot they use our driveway to
22:08
go through it which has a lot of heavy trucks and it's been pushing our driveway down so it has been disturbing
22:15
us a lot um and causing a little bit of push underneath in the basement um on
22:21
top of that uh we also don't believe that the property was surveyed correctly um they had placed a stake Last Summer
22:28
and um saying that 2 ft from where the fence line is um going towards the house is their
22:36
property and we got it surveyed and it is not excuse me did you mean towards your house yes okay yes I brought I
22:43
brought the thing okay so so they're saying it's you're being
22:50
adversely uh what's the word for it encroached encroached encroached upon yeah for for two feet yeah okay so you
22:59
have you have essentially dueling surveys is what you're saying yes mhm
23:04
sure Fen is on your property no no no no no so our fence that's been there for a
23:10
long time I'm not 100% sure how long um it is to the property line the front
23:17
fence and it stops they removed the fence they removed Three Trees because he in Assumption when he
23:24
first got H it surveyed he assumed that that is his property we are glad the
23:30
trees are gone so we're not complaining about that however we are missing a fence and we just want to make sure that
23:37
it gets surveyed correctly because we did go out and get it surveyed we paid money for it mhm do you believe that the
23:45
surveying that they did is wrong incorrect I do I went out there with r did complain did you complain to the
23:51
city or someone so I I don't know how to do this I'm just helping her I was told
23:56
to go get it surveyed that is what we did we have we have you know proof and pting um and then I walked over and
24:03
noticed that the other stake on that property is 2 ft from The Bread Company
24:09
parking lot so I don't know if they just moved 2 feet towards the house they just
24:14
need to move a two feet back and I think that you know everything will be fine surveying for that property um I still
24:21
don't understand what you just said I don't either she's thinking she's thinking that they they started at a point 2T to
24:27
the right so the whole the whole lot essentially on this survey in in her opinion is is
24:34
shifted two feet to the right I that that that's the only thing you're saying the remedy you're saying the remedy
24:39
would be if they moved everything to feed back yeah if they when they initially surveyed it if they just moved
24:45
2 feet over they would have been correct and we wouldn't even need to get it surveyed but because she strongly
24:51
believed that it was not incorrect we went out and got it surveyed and he the guy did not ask for anything he just
24:58
went by however surveys go and this is what he gave us and um it says where the
25:03
stake is and where the fence goes do you have that survey with you yes did they
25:11
so I think I heard you say they removed your fence yeah that's was my next question they did they talk to you about
25:18
that prior to removing it it seems as though they believed it was their fence they removed the trees
25:25
too and get M yeah so they thought it was
25:30
yes but are I guess you're assuming accidentally
25:36
because they believed it was on their property or you saying they nefariously went onto your property to remove well
25:42
technically he did if this survey is correct technically he did he technically removed our our our fence
25:48
the trees again we were okay with that MH trust me um
25:53
but we didn't get really anything back mhm for that like off fence to go back
25:59
on the side so that way you know it's just did you talk to them did you ask for a so I haven't we haven't seen him
26:07
he's always busy vice versa so um in and out a lot the same right here the fence
26:15
you're talking about it's the fence between the two properties it's a chain link it was it was it was did they take
26:22
the whole thing down oh yes because they thought it was on their property according to their service y okay we
26:28
assume that's what they thought yeah and I'm
26:34
assuming 2et off that's property
26:39
line and you said your driveway property line it's a Shar driveway this um that's
26:47
owned by somebody else but we are able to access it so it's like um the L I I I
26:52
don't know if it has like a cause in it but is it from Cliff Street or is it from the back so so they shed themselves
26:59
at 2 ft it's this right here if you go by the oh I am so sorry I'm not could
27:05
you just bring it up here thank you even with my glasses on that's not
27:10
going to it's right here so this is the share driveway we use it okay cuz this shows a garage there so that's on the
27:16
other side we're on this side oh so this driveway goes all the way back but this driveway this driveway goes all the way
27:23
back towards the Bread Company um lot back there and also to the other proper
27:28
that I believe he own don't don't leave so this survey this bold line is the property line this one the Bold one
27:35
that's what the outer one [Music]
27:40
is she's saying it's that chain link fence was you're saying the chain link
27:46
fence is the property line it's not near street is it okay you have a survey that shows it's on the other side of the
27:52
street now right here tie this survey and show me how it shows the chain link as the property one so
27:59
right here they took it chain link out by the way right here um it's 8.3 ft 8.3
28:05
yeah so I took measuring tape and I walked to the corner of the house where it says and I walked out 8.3 ft the keep
28:12
the same orientation you have Cliff Street Cliff Street you're saying 8.3 from the corner I don't even know what
28:18
the what's being goes to the proper looking at the other side no no this side this side this side
28:27
so these houses are like this actually sorry right oh this is your house yeah
28:35
this is your house so you went 8.3 ft off your house to the property line and
28:42
you're saying 8.3 ft is where the chain link was mhm so I think yeah right
28:49
there and then that's where it was and this
28:55
driveway on their house M goes all the way back it does but also this one this
29:02
is the one they primarily use they don't really use that one as much so this D
29:07
goes all the way back it doesn't stop there no there's no more fence here this is your house correct so this
29:15
side they're they're using the driveway all now I'm confused yeah so she's implying that this driveway here on the
29:22
right goes all the way back and doesn't stop there as the
29:28
plan sorry see so she's saying this driveway here
29:34
yep stops it does but excuse me she's saying this driveway here goes all the way
29:40
back and it also goes back on your property too no it's not a driveway on
29:46
your side so these are two properties though right this is six this is eight
29:51
this one is correct it goes behind the building to to and what do you have a right away on that dri that's her
29:58
property this is not her property no no the driveway this one is this goes back we are able to drive this is the
30:03
property of this property but this survey I mean is the survey of really
30:08
that's why it's disorientation so you're challenging the
30:14
Integrity or the the validity of this survey in front of us correct yeah is what you're saying yep yep that's all I
30:22
don't care like I said I don't care what you know you buy your property you do whatever you want no that's not true oh
30:29
you do whatever you want no no no we have a zoning board of appeals to come to us well that's why I'm here
30:36
yeah that's interesting so what do we do
30:42
boss mhm do we um
30:48
no do we require them [Music]
30:53
to yeah that' be great yeah okay yeah
30:59
wow what do you do in this situation I think that so you know we're
31:05
not here to right so the issue is we're not here to uh adjudicate dri property dispute right so but we don't know we
31:13
have we it appears as though we have two different surveys with two different plots um which is a
31:22
problem um but we can't take as a given no the proposal we've gotten the
31:29
other issue it potentially is um yeah the the lot size
31:35
of course the variance being granted is based on the lot size so if we're taking the lot down that's what I was so
31:42
there's a concern to that respect as well so all right if if you look to me
31:48
for any input on this typically as I always you know sort of advise you guys
31:54
um when there's disputes between property owners and I encourage them to always try to
31:59
resolve it on their own between meetings this has implications in as much as it is the lot size but this to me seems
32:08
that a survey is a survey right it's it's as close to objective as property
32:14
can be right it's basic measurement so it might be the case that the surveyors
32:19
may need to speak to each other and figure out what is correct the issue for the zba is you can't Grant a variance
32:26
assuming something is correct right we have to know that the square footage is what they say and of course at the end
32:32
of the day it's your decision but this is my legal advice in this situation you don't want to Grant a variance that does
32:38
not apply for example right all right uh I think the applicant wants to speak
32:43
again so if you could do you guys have anything else you want to bring up you have the floor
32:51
so is a very small Road and if you put two families in there you have um at
32:58
least four cars that have to be parked in front and it would be really impossible
33:06
well except they have they have parking for four cars they would have the parking for four cars also in the drive remind you
33:14
the use is not issue tonight right oh we did we
33:19
wanted to know the Park yeah no absolutely and while you're talking I looked it up real quick it's a minimum
33:24
of one one parking spot per dwelling unit not per bedroom as you see
33:30
typically in a lot of towns so really if you look at it I think two parking spaces is the minimum and you're they're
33:37
explaining that they have four so they they've got more than what's needed maximum of six you did say that and
33:42
that's correct but a minimum is just one per dwelling unit but the one driveway is a shared driveway no no no no they
33:49
are two driveways that are they have two driveways the other the driveway they're talking you're thinking of Duties on the
33:55
other side this other one on what other side so there's one on
34:00
this side and one on this side right yep those are both exclusive uses for this yep and where's the other
34:08
one to the right of their house this is owned by this lot but they have an
34:14
easement oh to the right of their house we yeah Cliff Street is interesting I've
34:22
sold on CLI so before I ask for continuance um
34:30
just good idea um so what we'll do is take the
34:36
next month hopefully um and resolve the issues of the lot line as you said it now goes to lot size which now goes to
34:42
setback etc etc um I just would like it noted that there was no objection and
34:49
certainly welcome to come back up about architecture the addition or concerns with what we're doing so uh I don't
34:56
think we said that I no no from the you guys okay so we never got to that all
35:04
right so with that if I could ask for if she's comfortable email it so that you
35:09
guys can see the survey I I have a cop give this y exactly um you don't mind
35:16
just uh I have access all right we're just what I would like to do is just enter this into the record so we'll keep
35:22
this and just load it upload it so it becomes part of the city's record if that's okay with you great thank you um
35:28
all right um he's asked for a continuous in a German you like in a German yeah all right um continu okay
35:36
uh have any other questions before uh on any of the other stuff just to for the
35:42
process of shine streamlining right we don't want to come back next month it doesn't sound like you guys had other questions but um let's just get well I'm
35:50
just I'm just presuming you didn't know about this alternative survey no I didn't so I I think I I think I mean I
35:58
don't want to prejudge anything I think I need to know the correct facts before I look into it yeah yeah so yeah I'm not
36:06
ready yeah so with that being said uh I'd like to uh adjourn the public hearing um to next month's meeting uh if
36:15
um if you need longer um you'll let uh the zoning secretary know uh so it can
36:21
be noticed properly um can use uh Mercedes what is the date of the um next
36:28
meeting I think it's the 18th again for some strange reason March 18th all right so the next just so you're aware um the
36:34
next meeting is scheduled for March 18th um and so this will be put on for then but if they're not able to um have it
36:42
resurveyed uh and Reen noticed by then then they'll have to ask for a further adjournment so just if you keep looking
36:48
at the city's website just so you're aware of when uh the next time we'll be having a public hearing on this all
36:54
right do I have to get it resed no no no you don't you don't have to do anything and I mean I I I would encourage I would
37:01
talk to your surveyor um and just and and encourage the the surveyors to talk
37:07
to one another um that would be my you know advice as much as I can give it um
37:14
all right so uh can I have a motion to adjourn the public hearing uh on I just want I just want to say one more thing
37:20
um if you're having an issue with heavy trucks in your driveway and it's
37:27
actually affecting your foundation you're saying it's going into the basement I would really look into
37:37
that I would first go to the building department okay why are they going on
37:43
your property do they have your permission there's not enough room yeah
37:48
come yeah if you're going to all right this what I said any more questions driveway is owned by the
37:54
person who owns the bread company from my knowledge all this stuff and this is to the this is to the right of your
38:00
house so a full a full looking at it yes a full house away
38:06
from their property correct yeah okay yep so they the owner has more
38:12
properties um one two I want to say the third lot in he's renovating a whole
38:18
bunch of a building over there behind yeah yeah this particular owner yes the
38:25
same owner yes so does he own or do they own the driveway that you have an easeman over not not this guy uhhuh the
38:34
person that owns the bride company owns that driveway yep that's right so it's not your driveway no it is a shared
38:40
driveway but we are allowed to drive on it they got to ride away yes are you are you able to park where is your parking
38:47
right behind the house two cars they park there got it so you you have Ingress and egress but you can't park in
38:53
the driveway you can you can go you can Traverse the driveway to get to your parking but you can't park a car in your
38:58
driveway yeah pretty much because you need to keep that open for yeah yep yep
39:04
but they're but they're using that driveway for their yes for yeah okay construction but just so I understand
39:10
too and so the record is clear because I I haven't seen that survey so this is all conceptual that construction is the
39:18
construction on other properties correct nothing to do with the property issue at
39:23
six Cliff Street so he does both so you can you can access six Cliff
39:30
Street through this okay yep okay so it come around the back yeah yeah all right
39:35
yeah W okay yeah all
39:41
right any other questions for now no I'd like to I'll wait for the survey I'm
39:46
sure I have more questions then yeah when we discuss factors I agree I agree yeah okay very good all right so uh can
39:53
I have a motion for an adjournment uh for agenda item number one please so moved I can I have a second second all
40:00
right motion by Stow second by Judy all in favor I all
40:07
right and then George for uh miscellaneous business agenda item number two can you just um yes can you
40:14
just review um the dates on on that so we can yeah yeah be clear so this is an
40:22
extension request for um 11 Highland Place you may recall this came before
40:27
the board um at two meetings April 16th 2024 and June 18th
40:32
2024 um a vote was held was had on um June 18th 2024 closed public hearing and
40:40
the resolution to approve the variance was granted at that meeting the resolution itself was dated July 2nd
40:47
2024 um and so the applicant had 6 months
40:52
from the date of the resolution to basically uh you know the conditions that we always impose to get a build
40:59
which is obtain the building permit right um and then all the other stuff that comes out of the obtaining the
41:04
building permit so given July 2nd 2024 it would
41:10
be January 2nd 2025 that it expired on they are requesting an extension they
41:15
have not from what I understand been able to obtain this building permit yet they're still dealing with uh you know
41:22
whatever circumstances they're dealing with so this would be a six-month extension but r proactive in as much as
41:28
it's from that January 2nd 2025 date so it wouldn't be 6 months from today it
41:34
would be 6 months from janary when it expired so it would take it to um
41:41
July 2nd 2025 to be a year yeah a year it's two
41:47
six months extensions um Cory do you know um they if they've had any contact
41:53
with your office on this uh if they're working towards uh that's a building permit or anything
42:02
so the only problem with that is that something Bruce would have handled okay I've just been in his position for about a week now congratulations so probably
42:09
only another another week more but um not not that I know of um to find that out I'd have to go through all the
42:15
emails and whatnot understood explain why go ahead just give us one minute yep
42:21
and so uh um and what is the legal standard for that's what I was just
42:28
going to get to right um courts are they frown upon declining extension
42:35
requests and basically the two things you want to focus on is not necessarily
42:40
to a lesser extent but for lack of a better term to a lesser extent good faith effort by the applicant to
42:46
actually get the work done um but more so maybe a 5149 kind of balance the
42:52
circumstances has there been a change in circumstances or a change in law yes applicable right um so what it comes
43:01
down to is typically courts you know they frown upon declining to extend if
43:06
there hasn't been a change in circumstances um and when I say change in C I mean you know the lot's been
43:12
destroyed or something something substant a substantive change um but if
43:17
we're talking about 10 years down the road and you're still asking for extension request then it's more feasible to say well you know the person
43:25
may not have done anything or whatever the case may be It's Not Unusual to Grant even one or
43:31
two or three six-month extension requests right and I know that we doed
43:36
at this point it it is timely they they're they made the application after
43:43
the January 2nd expiration but you can retroactively extend and again it's not
43:49
uncommon um especially I guess given the holiday season sometimes things you know
43:54
fall apart in terms of time I guess the only question is relative to the change in circumstance did the law did the
44:00
parking law change affect this does the parking law change off the top of my
44:08
head does the parking law change the three maximum prohibit this parking it
44:14
would if someone if she came to us today it would that's that's I mean that's that's the question is at har that's the
44:21
issue so so the so I would I would want to know what was
44:27
allowed mhm under the Old Law what did we give a variance to and then what
44:32
would be allowed under the new law I can tell you what you gave a variance to
44:38
yeah um the variance was granted um and there was a condition
44:47
that the applicant shall remove the parking space in the existing driveway that is nearest to the existing dwelling
44:53
and shall demarcate same in a manner that is feasible and simultaneously indic indicative that there shall be no
44:58
parking in that space the existing driveway on the property inter turn will be reduced from the three current spaces
45:04
to two spaces and then that was for the existing you know there were three
45:10
spaces next to the proposed circular driveway the proposed circular driveway I don't really remember how many cars
45:16
were maybe two so it would been four two or three I it was two they were talking
45:23
about parking two cars in it but it was large enough if I recall to now Bruce
45:29
said it would hold two cars yeah I think there should be four total yeah but the circular driveway would hold two cars
45:36
correct yep so and so what what what is the legal maximum now under the law
45:44
three agre right and and I want to make a point which
45:49
was that we are also giving the variance not just for the number of parking spaces but the fact that it was a
45:56
circular driveway in front of the house between the the front door of the house and the street right which is against
46:04
the zoning well that was the variance right that's the variance right I just want to make that clear there there was no it wasn't just a parking number of
46:11
cars yeah well correct and there was not a need for a variance from that right at that point but in theory there would be
46:18
now now right so and so the original variance was the parking in front of the house but now we also have this concern
46:25
well we do we may yeah we we may sure conceivably if someone came to us today
46:30
we would have both issues do we have to consider it as of today or do we are we evaluating our vote given today's
46:37
circumstances or are we just looking at the circumstances as to why there was a delay both and so that's that's what
46:42
that's what I believe if I'm if I understood George correctly it's it's essentially the the the legal standard
46:48
for granting uh extensions are change in circumstance which there is there's a
46:53
change in the law and two is good faith effort so we're gonna let the applicant right yeah so we're going to
47:00
let the applicant speak to her good faith efforts that she's made and then we can make a
47:05
decision okay if he'd like to to do
47:11
that hi everyone um I was told by my architect actually name oh sorry Jody
47:17
MCC 11 Highland play speaking hello um I actually didn't think that I I didn't realize that the the parking law had
47:23
changed but I thought that that didn't matter cuz it's a variance extension and not a request for variance but I'm not sure how that works um we've been
47:29
working on this there was a financial difficulty because the escrow was a little bit different and more costly
47:35
than we had expected it to be because of the postponement to the meeting so I ended up owing an additional
47:42
$560 to the original escrow when I had kind of anticipated getting some money
47:47
back to help pay for the driveway um and then I paid another $500 for tonight so
47:53
it's it's been a lot more costly for that reason and then on top of that that um you know we kind of had an idea in
47:58
our mind of exactly how we wanted to design this when the
48:04
board granted the variance and said to give back the other parking spot that kind of changed the whole thing in our
48:10
head of what we wanted to do so we actually spent more money um we hired an architect and a landscape designer to
48:16
look into how to make that as nice as possible because you know we want it to be pretty for the neighborhood and
48:23
everything um our architect then said that we might need to hire an engineer because there are some grading issues
48:29
because we've had some leaks from the houses that were built across the street from me because I now have driveways
48:34
pointing down toward my house where there used to be a whole lot of trees and grass and and Forest basically so
48:41
that all kind of changed everything that we were doing so there's there's been a lot of additional
48:47
expense and additional work that's gone into it that kind of led to the delay yeah that kind of pushed everything back
48:54
cuz we we really wanted to have this done by the winter right now you know when it snows we've got cars all over our front lawn because it's it's
49:01
definitely not as nice as it will be once the driveway is done what's up so
49:06
in the intervening period though the things you've done have been mostly talking with people and and planning and
49:12
redrawing plans and so on but you haven't for example actually taken away some of the
49:18
parking next to your house that was part of the the the the grant we gave you the
49:24
zoning no we're going to do everything at once just to to make it more cost effective because this has been costing so much
49:31
more money than we thought it would I'm just trying to get it like good faith efforts on your part to actually move
49:36
forward that's all yeah well I just figured the actual work would get done at the same time we just wanted to design it first so that because you know
49:42
taking the parking like we just we just want to make sure that it's it's aesthetically pleasing so we didn't
49:50
want to start doing anything until we had our our plan and knew what we wanted it to look like if they took the exist
49:56
ing parking they have now away before they put in the new they'd have no place
50:03
to [Music] park yeah but that's that's an interesting question because that's
50:09
something that's going to hit other home owners in the city when they come to the board and want to make a change and the
50:17
board will point out oh well we have now got a limit of three parking spaces what are you going to do about it I mean
50:24
that's that's something we're going to have to face in a lot of cases I think
50:30
right you can only do what the law tells you to do at that time right exactly so people will have four parking spaces
50:37
that you know we wouldn't allow to have again and and the house that was just here has two driveways so and that still
50:44
a one family so I mean that's and some of them may be able to get variances for an extra parking space right you can't
50:51
decide that now okay all right um
50:57
so so we just wanted some extra time to figure out to finish what we've been working on yep understood all right you
51:05
so um I will take a motion either way make
51:13
a motion to approve all right so we have a motion to approve by monos can I have a second second second uh by Elaine and
51:21
then I'll just uh call the role uh Elaine yes montos yes I am a yes uh Judy
51:27
yes yes and St yes yes all right so we have a uh unanimous extension through uh
51:35
July 2nd 2025 um to open the building to open a
51:42
building permit yes and then will will that time will that extend that yeah
51:48
that extends sort of all the conditions right so so yeah okay so it pushes back
51:53
so it's six so it's 6 months from January 2nd so July 2nd to get the
52:00
building permit M then 6 months from that date to begin construction yeah so
52:05
it's it's like taking the whole entire resolution and just put slapping a
52:11
different date on it shifting it over so great awesome the resolution apprciate
52:17
it absolutely okay uh can I have a motion to adjourn uh the February
52:23
meeting of the zoning board of appeals motion to adjourn motion by Duty second by montos all in favor I all right next
52:31
meeting is Tuesday March 19th 18th 18th
52:36
18th very good thank you 18th yeah okay
