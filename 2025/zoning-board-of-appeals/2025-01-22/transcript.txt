good evening and W okay here we go good evening and welcome to the Wednesday January 22nd 2025 meeting of the city of
0:23
Beacon zoning board of appeals I am Jordan H and I am the chairman of this board uh joining us tonight are my
0:29
fellow board memb MERS our attorney George our secretary and our building outgoing
0:36
building inspector thank you for your time here Bruce um all the application
0:43
materials that will be discussed tonight including any proposed resolutions and any other documents are available on the
0:48
city's website also on the city's website is a link to the rules and procedures of the zoning board of
0:54
appeals I'll take a minute to explain uh the board's procedures um we'll hear
1:00
each application uh for each application we'll hear uh first from the applicant and then we'll open up to the floor
1:05
which seems to be so crowded this evening um if you wish to comment please step up to the podium uh when called
1:11
upon uh and clearly state your name and address to the record um all comments should be directed to the board not the
1:17
applicant or the city staff um and then since uh it doesn't appear
1:24
well let me go through it anyway uh so there are uh two variances on for tonight uh both both area variances uh
1:31
and so we are beholden to a factor test five Factor test and so the the five
1:38
things that we as a board can consider uh and so this will be beneficial to speak to uh those five things uh are uh
1:46
will an undesirable change be produced in the character of the neighborhood or a detriment to nearby properties be
1:52
created by the granting of the proposed variants uh will the proposed action uh
1:57
com well that's a repeat uh will can the benefit sought by the applicant be achieved by some feasible by by some
2:04
method feasible for the applicant to pursue other than the area variance is the area variance substantial will the
2:11
proposed variance have an adverse effect or impact on the physical or environmental conditions in the
2:16
neighborhood or District um is the alleged difficulty self-created and then
2:22
we are obligated to Grant the minimum variance necessary uh by by request
2:31
thank you um board uh the minutes for the November
2:37
19th 20124 meeting were circulated prior to this meeting um does anyone have any
2:42
uh comments or concerns or proposed edits to those minutes and if not uh can I have a
2:49
motion to accept those minutes motion to accept uh motion to accept by monos can
2:55
I have a second second second by St all in favor I I abstain I wasn't here
3:01
excellent 4 40 40 and 01 with an
3:06
abstention um all right um so before we open the public hearing um on agenda
3:12
item number one uh George can you just give us a primer on uh this application
3:18
I know it would it's kind of coming back sort of um from a previous application
3:24
that was submitted um for the March 21st 2023 meeting so somehow almost 2 years
3:30
old already yeah um I'm getting grayer by the meeting me me too yep um so if
3:36
you could just give us an intro yeah absolutely so the first one we're dealing with is uh five Willow Street uh
3:42
you may recall this came back before this came before the board for the first
3:47
time back in um May 2023 and June 2023
3:52
those two meetings um there's been that variance back then it was uh several
4:00
variances partly granted partly denied and basically the long story short is there's an edit to the plan now which is
4:07
the proposed Breezeway connection between the existing two-story accessory
4:13
building in the back corner of the property and connecting the existing two story um two family in the in the center
4:19
of the property the reason this is a different a new application as opposed
4:24
to just an extension is the work is different right so when we approve or when you guys approve variances it's limited to the application as presented
4:31
because there are changes it is a new application even though it looks the same so that's pretty much the uh the
4:38
primer on this they're back um you know with a new plan we'll hear from them you guys will hear from them you'll ask your
4:44
questions and uh you know that's that's pretty much it that's like they adjourned right yeah they've adjourned
4:50
several times um I think this was originally maybe September we we got
4:56
this application a few months ago and they've adjourned a couple times so um and that was like last month uh I
5:03
think that was due to maybe short of board members a couple meetings and then unavailability for the applicant to
5:09
couple meetings so they've adjourned but now I believe they should be here tonight so George just for uh
5:17
recollection uh what variances did we approve yeah on that application so previously back at that time give me a
5:24
second here um it was
5:31
the approved variances back then were the side yard um setback and uh rear
5:38
yard setback those were approved which are similar to those now uh just a couple tweaks a matter of quite
5:44
literally inches it's uh that's you know the setback behind the building in the
5:50
right corner and then the sidey yard setback as well um very minimal the variance that was denied back then was a
5:57
variance to allow more than one m building on a lot where not more than one main building this might start
6:03
jogging the memory so that was denied but the other two were approved those area variances um and I suspect it means
6:10
nothing without that first variance so they've they've tweaked the plan I know they've spoken to Bruce about this in
6:15
the building department and uh it's gone through iterations and and that's what we're here for today so sorry to just
6:22
continue to interrogate before we open the public hearing but so Bruce so it is now B the new plan um
6:30
basically there your you your determination is is that there is not a a second main building based on new
6:37
configuration yes correct so by them connecting the two buildings together essentially making it now one building
6:43
on the property got it okay okay thank you all right can I have a motion to
6:49
open the public hearing on agenda item number one so moved motion by Stoke and I have
6:55
a second second second by Judy all in favor I I is that my chance to make a
7:00
comment not yet no not yet not yet soon so um if the applicant could come and
7:06
present please it was St and Judy
7:14
yeah USB there you go I'm going to have to get an adapter out of my I'm Jeff
7:20
Battersby by the way you now met my whole family
7:40
and I'm grateful that you're seeing us again and also Rea s his regrets he's uh
7:46
not well tonight so he was not able to make it he would have he would have been here I simply just plugged that in and
7:53
it you plug it in and then I there's something that pops up and eventually you press that circle on the little USB
8:02
dongle there and it'll software it will yeah you go to like your my
8:21
computer all the text stuff now just press the
8:27
yeah it's still loading there you go
8:33
see there you go approve the side set back yes but you said we approved yeah
8:41
yeah back in uh back in June it was an approval and I can tell you the we
8:46
approved it for what use well the they have a dwelling unit on that the no the use was the separate whole separate
8:53
issue we were just looking at area variances there were no uses use variances then but there was nothing done with that unit at the time right no
9:00
because they needed all three yeah but we broke it down it was essentially rendered useless I would imagine and the
9:07
applicant could answer that but my understanding is without the the one to allow more than one building right it
9:13
there was nothing to be done they were before us one other time before that for
9:19
having an accessory apartment with a there was a they were before us once
9:24
before because it was a two family home that they wanted to add the accessor Department to correct we've been here
9:31
first time right the second time was the two principal structures on the line and now this is yeah this third so that's
9:39
that's absolutely correct and we uh again appreciate that you have had us here to do this um and you are correct
9:45
there were a couple of other postponements we really wanted the full contingent of the of the zoning board
9:50
here which is why um we we pushed it off we were given the opportunity to come
9:56
but I I would prefer to have all of you here um so the idea is really from our
10:02
perspective yes a renewal of the pre-existing uh variants that you gave us it it's basically the setbacks that
10:08
we're concerned with but we did speak with the building department and uh found a way that we could make it so it
10:14
became instead of uh a a separate accessory building these two buildings
10:20
are combined together as you can see they're joined uh with basically a a
10:25
pass through um and the idea is that we
10:30
essentially conjoin these two buildings we provideed so that they're all together they're con considered a single
10:37
a single physical dwelling uh on the property yes it will have the three the
10:43
three separate units in that and just so you understand the idea behind this the real this is a house that's been here
10:50
since the 1800s late 1800s um the the building the barn that's on it is an original is an original to that we want
10:57
to maintain as much as that or original quality without allowing it just to fall into the ground which um about I want to
11:04
say 10 years ago um we did quite a bit of work on it to restructure that to
11:10
make sure that it was supported and well taken care of and this is the next phase of that this is the idea that we want to
11:16
have so um in keeping with the spirit of the zoning laws you know we've uh worked
11:22
along with the the building inspector to uh to tie the two together and to make it so it's a a a single connected
11:30
building um and it allows us the opportunity to do the Rehab on this that
11:36
we would like to do we want to be able to to make it into another you know another place but the expense of doing
11:43
that for you know making it into a garage um it makes it difficult to be able to to do that kind of work so we we
11:51
wanted to enhance it in that way so it's not that different than what
11:56
you saw before other than you know what what what is now joining these two buildings together can you describe that
12:03
a little bit what the what the conjoining sure so there is um let's see
12:09
if I can zoom this for you a little
12:20
bit so what you see here and this is uh if you're looking at the right hand side
12:27
up here what you have is uh the existing house on the right hand side um we've added a uh a porch to that
12:35
so that that's a porch That's added so there's some space uh for the people who
12:41
live there happens to be my daughter this is uh while my mother doesn't live
12:47
on the property it's owned by my mother um this is a place that the family lives both of my daughters have lived here uh
12:54
both together and and now my daughter my oldest daughter and her wife uh her
13:00
husband could be wife um her husband lives there um so what we have is we
13:07
have a a pathway that's joined between the two of those we have a covering that
13:12
is there um that covering will be completely covered on the top and uh it
13:18
allows direct passage between the two buildings and it's basically it's basically a pass through
13:26
that is connecting the two um with a roofing structure or a covered structure
13:32
that goes over the top of it and then with a stone pathway if you look at
13:37
it so in essence it's a corridor connecting it is a corridor correct two parts that's a fair that is a fair
13:44
assessment of what it is so it is a corridor is this in a multif family zoning area multif family permitted
13:52
we're in the T-Zone yeah so there yeah this is allowed it's in the the transitional
13:58
Zone um so multif family is allowed they need to have a minimum of 2500 square
14:03
fet per dwelling unit and I believe this property has I think just about 8,500
14:09
Square ft so they meet the requirement for the three units and don't need uh an
14:14
additional variance for that thank you
14:24
welcome and then can you just describe the the uses of the three units um so
14:29
there there's an upstairs unit and there's a downstairs unit the downstairs main building I'm sorry in the main
14:35
building in the main building correct upstairs unit uh and a downstairs unit there's a front entrance for the
14:40
upstairs unit this is the main entrance the back entrance for the downstairs unit the third unit would again be it's
14:48
a small Studio I believe it comes in just a little over a th000 square ft total both for the upstairs and the uh
14:54
downstairs again using the existing uh structure the existing um floor plan of
15:00
the uh what was there um so it is a a again a
15:05
single could be a couple you but it's one bedroom a bedroom upstairs uh a bathroom upstairs and a bathroom laundry
15:13
downstairs in a kitchen in a small living area down below and the the main
15:18
the it shouldn't call it main but the existing structure will its use will remain the same and that's been its use
15:24
as a two family for for many years yes okay so we're saying ultimately it's going to be a three apartment or three
15:33
living units whatever correct three three living units in in what is now two
15:39
different buildings but are going to be conjoined correct so it'll be a single building with three units in a long
15:46
quarter well not that long but yeah it's it it ends up being I think about about
15:51
12T between the two buildings maybe a little more than that and why do you need this well there's two pieces to it
15:58
the first part is what said we want to we want to have a way of being able to rehab that building rather than just
16:04
destroying it um partially because it's from the 1800s and we like to restore it to some semblance of that uh and the
16:12
other part of it is the the cost in rehabbing that particular building the
16:19
the best way to recover it is to make it into into a unit where people can live
16:25
um again a rental I'm sorry it would be a rental correct yeah not interested in
16:32
in any kind of shortterm anything this is this is full rental in the time that
16:37
that my mother has owned this place by the way I lived here for a period of time uh my family did when we uh built
16:45
our house up on Mountain Lane we had lived on Mountain Lane since 1990 lived in an 825 ft house that's on drybrook if
16:53
you know where drybrook is right below the the uh um the water tank this City
16:59
water tank that's up there and so we lived in this this house for that period
17:05
of time um we used one of the units for storage because we had so much stuff in the other house and then we lived in the
17:10
other um so this has been a two family it was a two family with two separate uh
17:16
utilities since the day that we bought it um and then we uh we started renting
17:24
it once we moved into the house as a two family house um from that time
17:29
forward can you talk I'm sorry I was just going you keep referring it to as a
17:35
restoration or how much of the original garage is actually
17:41
reusable um it looks in it's it is and part of it is it's taken us two years to
17:46
get to this point so part of it is it's it has no roof um we did as I said before some structural work about 10
17:55
years ago might be a little more than that uh and so that restructure that we did is is much
18:04
of what will be the base structure for the new for the new building um it looks
18:10
pretty much it would be a tear down and rebuild um we are trying to avoid that
18:16
but it's possible that it would come to that I mean in in all honesty that would be you know it it is our hope to retain
18:23
as much as possible um but again the more time that passes the more difficult that that becomes so um but the idea is
18:31
at the very minimum um we we would maintain the spirit of what that
18:36
original building was so keep it in in that in that line regarding the gravel driveway it says here expanded gravel
18:43
driveway what is the driveway today it is gravel and actually uh we probably does this reflect the current it is the
18:50
current yeah this is there's no side yard setbacks required on this driveway the driveway looks to be quite
18:58
large that's pre-existing that's what's there at this moment yeah usually yeah usually is a 5 foot setback that's what
19:05
the current code requires so that's 5 foot there no I
19:10
think it's pre-existing nonconforming yeah but I believe that I believe the driveway is already there I believe that's all gravel currently okay so
19:18
pre-existing non-conforming as the chairman says got and how many cars do you expect will be parking here with
19:24
that new accessory building plus your the intention is this shows six cars because I believe
19:32
the either the zoning board or the planning board or or one of the boards required that we have uh space for six
19:39
vehicles um and it will this shows those all in line actually all those Vehicles
19:44
can can if they were required if we if we had to have six Vehicles there um
19:50
would be uh we can fit six there on an angle so pulling in at an angle that
19:56
said uh we have with current it's never had more than permanently two vehicles
20:02
there you know when they have people visit there are there are more than that but typically no more than how does that
20:08
align Bruce with what we just talked about earlier about the one and three yeah so the currently the new um
20:15
the new Provisions in the zoning code for parking um are now there's a minimum standard which is one per dwelling unit
20:23
and then there's um a maximum number as well which is uh three uh three cars per
20:28
dwelling unit so they would have to provide at least a minimum of three but then they could have a maximum of nine
20:34
if this was approved wow so we're we're in the middle in the yeah and and in
20:40
reality we you know we don't want to make a parking lot when I say don't want to make a parking lot
20:46
that right now it's currently hidden by a big uh there's a big bush in the front
20:52
of that that hides the cars that are currently parked in that space um
20:57
aesthetic is very important to us you know what it looks like and and the idea
21:03
of making it into you know we wouldn't have had six we would have put three on this plan but at the time that this
21:10
original plan was created six was the number that we were told that that remember that we would need so one of
21:17
the things about this property is um obviously it's walkable to everything on Main Street um my kids walk to the
21:23
grocery store my daughter and my my son-in-law walked to the grocery store they walk to the train station they walk
21:29
to all the places that they need to go um my son-in-law Works around the corner
21:35
at Myers Old Dutch he walks to work every day um this is really the beauty
21:41
of this is that it is uh walkable to mass transit uh walkable to the bus if
21:46
you need the bus and uh walkable to everything on Main Street and we would encourage anybody
21:52
that was was renting that uh to you know use use that that freely you know the
22:00
ability to walk freely I have a question
22:05
for either or both George and Bruce this
22:11
connection in Pre we've had at least one
22:17
similar case before 30 um 359 Cherry
22:23
Street where they were putting it and they did a fully enclosed connection
22:29
between the main house and the accessory dwelling making it part of the house now
22:37
this does not even have for part of it not even a foundation it's just a canopy
22:45
and a walkway if you were selling the house that would not be included in the square
22:51
footage of the house yeah in any way how does it make it part of the original
22:57
dwelling physically it's now physically connected to one so it's a it's the physical
23:04
connection is making it now one structure if I run something from my house to my
23:11
shed it's now part of my house it is if you put a roof on it all it needs is a
23:17
roof all the stuff you roof that that's attached to your house becomes part of the square footage of the house not your
23:22
porch yeah if you put a roof on it they they count that towards the assessor does that you know when they they
23:29
inventory it on the uh on the records but it also has a foundation it's not it's not counted as it's not counted as
23:36
finish space but it is counted as like a porch space but it has a a porch would
23:42
have a foundation and at least a back wall but it doesn't need one right this is completely open necessary right you
23:50
could have a patio but again it's it's physically connecting the two structures together I mean the building code would
23:56
consider that a you know one build building at that
24:02
point so question what so I I
24:09
assume the concern the biggest concern or not not I assume my biggest concern is how close we are uh to the neighbors
24:20
in the back what I guess what is the reasoning or the theoretical reasoning
24:27
why it would make more sense to move it or it's just it's just not movable I guess right is and is that the reason
24:33
why it's it's to be restored for a lack of a better yeah
24:39
and I think part of it is then it would encroach on the existing building I
24:45
think is one piece of it the other is that that property sorry that building has
24:50
been in this location for over a 100
24:55
years yes so so it as a garage it doesn't as a gar actually
25:01
I think originally as a barn you know it has if you if you go into the open area
25:06
it's hard to see in the photograph that's that's there on the left but that open area is where they they rolled hay
25:12
bales into that into that building so you got pulled up that way
25:18
um it it exists there so it's not any change in what either the side yard
25:26
neighbors the rear yard Neighbors are accustomed to it is in an existing place and well it is I I'm sorry to disagree
25:34
with you but in my opinion it is because now you're making it a livable space okay fair okay and I don't want to put
25:41
words in the Chairman's mouth but I think where he was going with this is why not just extend the existing twostory house you have the rear yard
25:48
setback to do that without a variance and you could achieve your third unit I
25:55
I think I mean there is certainly a benefit to the third unit but that's not the primary
26:02
the the primary goal is to restore what was there um the secondary goal probably
26:08
equal to or similar similar to that is to be able to find a way to cover the
26:15
cost of that restoration um which is is using using it as a uh a separate unit um the
26:23
character of both the property and that building would change significantly if we moved
26:30
it uh to be a direct attach to the uh to the existing building and part of that
26:36
is you can see that there's great yard space back there that is used by all the tenants that that yard area behind it if
26:43
you attach it then you're then creating a barrier for some tenants to be able to
26:48
get into that particular piece of the property you know whether they they could walk around the outside of the house we're maintaining I believe the
26:55
Integrity of the property by doing that we're making it so still all potential
27:01
tenants of that property would have access to that open space which I think is beneficial I think that's a that's a
27:09
value ad as opposed to um taking something away from it um so those would
27:16
be the two main reasons that I'd say that uh I probably you know obviously in
27:22
the moment difficult to come up come up with others but that those would be the two biggest existing pieces of uh of
27:29
reasoning behind why you know why it would make less sense to uh
27:36
move move of it move that building off of its existing location and tie it
27:41
directly to the uh the the main building there's also the argument to be made in
27:47
your favor on honestly uh that building an an
27:53
additional space off the existing 2unit building would
27:58
decrease in some to some degree some of the amenities of the current two unit
28:05
building that is you block windows or correct whatever and and as a
28:11
result that would be less advantageous and for that back for the for the
28:17
downstairs unit we would have to change the entrance um the entrance that's a kitchen area where it where the uh
28:23
current entrance is it would have to change the entrance so it's on the side which would change the kitchen itself
28:30
um personally I don't think it would look as good it it would look to me it
28:35
would be um too claustrophobic to have all those
28:42
buildings stuck together like that the idea of openness feels and again to miss
28:49
I don't know how to pronounce your name chako um to her point it is open and
28:54
that you know that pass through is open and that allows Passage through rather than closure so
29:03
that would be my reasoning you know that would be the the structural reasoning behind not it's also kind of today's
29:10
thinking is that you wouldn't want to knock something down to put something else back up it's nice to be able to
29:17
reuse uh something that's already there and it's quite a nice structure I mean it needs help but
29:26
it's quite a nice structure you know was like a carriage house at one point sort
29:32
of where you know over the years so to me I think it's probably the most sane
29:41
thing to do with this property and the reason that they're putting this covered thing on is to make it you know is to
29:47
conform with what the what the what the zoning
29:54
requirements are so I I get this I I understand which you're you're trying to get I here's what I'm hearing there are
30:02
two two objectives here right the first one is to restore this building to its righteousness let's say
30:11
I think that's great but the second goal is to recoup the investment as quickly
30:16
as possible by a rental unit there's nothing wrong with that at the surface
30:22
but are there other family are there other Lots in this neighborhood that are more than two families
30:30
that I'm not sure I'd have to take a look I know most of the ones immediately in that area are all one family homes um
30:36
as you go I think a block away I think there's a couple that are uh might
30:42
beet West yeah but to be clear Bruce this is a zone that where that use
30:48
is permitted correct like if there were no se if there were no uh setback variances needed they could do this
30:53
correct yes correct yeah they could do that because it's uh in the transitional Zone it allows for multif family housing
31:02
um based upon the size of the lot that's the determining factor and so so and
31:08
remind me what was the reasoning what made what made something
31:14
what made it the previous application where it was a second mean dwelling versus an accessory dwelling what why
31:20
was that yeah there there is a section in the code that says you're only allowed to have one primary structure on
31:26
the property this was being proposed as an accessory structure which you're not
31:31
allowed and actually accessory structures were only allowed I believe for one family dwellings that's right I
31:37
see so because it was already a two right so it was already a two so it didn't qualify so the roof in effect
31:43
makes it the one building correct right yes by connecting it together making it
31:49
one and now becomes a a three family home so as proposed though it's all
31:54
inside the zoning requirements it's legal to have a building let's say you
31:59
were building it from scratch you were proposing to build that right you'd only
32:05
have to ask for the zoning variant for the setbacks no because it's a two family house no no no no this is that's
32:14
all in no no this is all legitimate except for the setbacks behind what is
32:21
in this case the current barn and that's not existing no but I'm saying if you
32:26
built it from scratch right the only variant you'd be asking for is the setbacks on the back of the on the side
32:32
yeah on the side and the rear correct yeah new constru that's all that's in front of us right so that's the only
32:37
have judge yep which you have granted to us before we just it took us more time to
32:45
to be able to come up with you know a reasonable a reasonable good-look
32:50
solution it took us more time to do that then I think we were granted we were
32:56
granted the zoning variance it was either for five or 6 months I don't six months so and that time when we
33:03
submitted again that that clock had run out so we had to come back here so so I
33:10
I'm going to ask the hypothetical which I guess could occur um what if it's
33:16
granted and then you go and it's determined that it's not salvageable and then the structure must be demolished um
33:25
what would you say at that point uh as far as what what would you want to do
33:30
what would you say about positioning at that point if that had to occur um I'm
33:36
not sure I understand the question so if we had to knock the whole thing down would we do something different with the with the structure or would we try to I
33:43
guess the location of the structure at that point so if if something wasn't there now or you know what what is there
33:51
was determined basically you know you gave a two prong reasoning so if one of your prongs went away meaning there was
33:58
nothing to restore because it was determined by whomever Engineers contractors that it couldn't be restored
34:04
it had to be sure
34:10
sorry mind you I I'm born and raised in California fires are not a fun thing to talk
34:16
about my my point is is that if if there was if you were not restoring the
34:22
existing structure or that was not a primary goal because it was not feasible
34:27
to be a goal based on the determination of professionals would you want to
34:34
construct it the way it is or would you would you would you change I would say yes I think the idea is to at at the
34:41
very least maintain the spirit of the original structure so in the event that
34:47
you know it burns down please no thank you um or it uh you know it's determined
34:55
that there is Maybe one beam available to be used from the original we would
35:01
use that beam and the idea is to really maintain the original Spirit of of what
35:09
this what this is and you know this is far into the future um has to get past
35:15
this but Our intention is then to um restore the main house to its original
35:21
it's got vinyl siding on it I'm no lover of vinyl siding I would like to you know
35:26
get back to the collabor that's underneath it and be able to do that but these are you know small steps so the
35:32
idea um is to maintain
35:38
uh the integrity and as I said the spirit of the original uh you know the
35:43
original so it it would to the naked eye the unknown eye
35:49
the you know the the non allseeing eye who doesn't know you know what's what's going on there it would look as if this
35:56
was the original piece so I hope that answers the
36:04
question kind of I guess and ask me deeper feel free yeah so I guess what in
36:10
my mind I'm I'm trying to weigh um is the intensity of the necessary variances
36:17
right so we've got a requested one foot side yard setback where 10 10 is
36:23
required and then a 1.4 uh 49 rear yard rear yard where 20 ft is required so
36:31
if the structure didn't need to be where it is because the plan is to restore it
36:36
and it just couldn't be in my hypothetical of it's determined that it
36:42
can't would there be a tradeoff where yeah you could still use some of the materials but you could move it in so
36:47
those setbacks were less intense would that be something I think if you bring it 10 ft
36:53
um I mean let me I can look at the measurements exactly and see but going to you're going to bring this property
37:00
then see if I can see what it is you're going to
37:09
bring unfortunately I don't see I don't see the distance between the two
37:14
buildings but you're going to bring those two buildings so close together if you follow the existing the uh existing
37:22
setback requirements as to make it
37:28
well it's one well it's one building right well if you brought it all together but that's that goes back to
37:34
the original question that you asked me previously which if we put it all together what are we loseing we lose access to the we lose access to the the
37:41
backyard which is available for all tenants I mean it's the it's the same question only different you know it's
37:47
it's framed in a little different way I I think we lose we lose the character of what it is if we try to do that um we we
37:54
you know we're conjoining things in that way you know making making those two buildings without leaving the opening
38:01
the open space between the uh between the two that already exists you're going to be living there I will not be living
38:07
there my daughter does live there and will continue to live there and she actually intends to move into that back place at this point the other two I'm
38:14
sorry the other two units so right now um the way that that property Works my
38:21
my oldest daughter her husband live uh in the downstairs unit uh their best friends live in the upstairs unit so
38:28
it's family as if my next daughter is very interested in In Living on the
38:34
property as well at some point in time in the event that something opens up which it would um you know in the event
38:40
that my daughter moved into the back building so you are the owner my mother is the owner I am power of attorney
38:49
so and this is her desire by the way she's wanted to do this since she bought the house back in 2004
38:58
all right um thank you I think we at least have one person from the public that wishes
39:05
to speak sure um so we'll let and I know that person great uh if you could uh
39:11
approach the podium and state your name and address for the record and if you could let her do that that would be
39:22
great Jill Reynolds 10 Willow Street could you say again Jill Reynolds 10
39:28
Willow Street hello and please pardon my appearance I just ran over here from work when I realized oh today's the 22nd
39:35
because I've been wanting to speak on this uh project for however many times
39:41
it's come up and then it kept getting pushed back and pushed back and pushed back um in my mind this project
39:49
epitomizes what we're trying to do with the transition zone in terms of um
39:55
increasing density uh in the center of s of town where who
40:02
you know tenants would have access to all the um fac you know everything on Main
40:08
Street and the train station and schools and everything um I'm a big fan of
40:16
walkability um I've lived across from this house for
40:22
over 20 years now and I'd be really glad really happy to see see it
40:29
improved um and and made a working part of the block and in terms of multif
40:36
family stuff there are other multif family dwellings on that block not on the street but on the
40:43
Block um more than two family I believe so on
40:53
um I always get it mixed up uh Cliff or cross cross street cross street yeah
41:01
yeah yeah several
41:07
um I think that's it anything else so you're in favor I'm in favor
41:14
yes thank you thank you I feel like there was something else I was going to say but it was
41:21
[Music] too I'm just T me crazy looking back
41:27
uh at some letters that were submitted back in the original application
41:40
um so there is one um there was there were two that were in
41:46
support um and then there was an additional one uh so this was sent uh March 20th
41:53
2023 um from the owners of nine Willow at the time time obviously I don't know if they still own the property um they
42:01
claimed that their house was adjacent to five Willow um they're happy to uh hear
42:06
that the carriage house was uh to be rebuilt um they're concerned about the
42:12
one yard setback one one foot setback um at that time they were concerned about
42:18
losing privacy which you know which is what I recall um at the time which which is my concern
42:24
um I think we discussed that they said about not putting a window they weren't going to put a window on the side that
42:30
was going to face that way yeah I think that was there originally was a window in the turn of the stairwell and that
42:37
was the one window on that side and they looks appears they took it out um it it's actually not out but we did speak
42:44
with those neighbors and again they're not here to speak for themselves so I can't I can tell you what we what we did
42:51
with them that window will be uh opaque sorry semi-opaque it'll allow light through but it'll be frosted so there'll
42:58
be no no visibility from that stairwell but we will be able to get the light that we need from the
43:03
stairwell okay uh any more questions uh for the
43:09
applicant uh or any more anybody else from the public wish to speak on this application no all right there was uh
43:17
back in October 15th an email from uh Stephen
43:22
weismore um about this application just want to make sure for the record that
43:28
it's confirmed that the email was received there were actually two questions concerns and I just wanted to
43:33
address those here quickly as well so that the neighbor understands that they have been taken into account um one of
43:40
the things they were wondering is how the reduced setback may impact their own property this is 182 Main Street by the
43:46
way how the uh the reduced setback may impact the own their own property
43:53
particularly with regard to any future plans they may have for development in including the potential placement of a
43:58
storage set or other structures and the answer to that is it will not affect the neighbor's development rights the
44:03
neighbor can develop in accordance with the the zoning code as necessary um and obviously we just discussed the one
44:10
window being opaque and I'm not even sure there's a window on this side um
44:15
there's skylights on the back side M but no windows okay so that's uh you know to
44:20
pick up for the microphone there's skylights on that side but no windows the other question was there is a tree on my property that is directly behind
44:27
Five Willow Street with the proposed new structure so close to the property line I am concerned that the tree could
44:32
become a liability or need to be removed which I would need to address um to that
44:37
extent there there's no new structure it's the existing structure here it's a renovation of that structure so any tree
44:43
that overhangs onto five Willow the owner of that property has the right to just cut straight up right so I you know
44:51
and since you're here today if they run into any issues we always say if you run into any issues with trees um you you
44:57
could always address it with your neighbor at that point but um my cursory glance at the plan probably does not
45:03
affect that tree at all so I wanted to get that on the record as well the Mr
45:08
wisemore went on to say I want to note that I am not opposed to the variance request but I am concerned about how it
45:13
may affect my property rights and responsibilities moving forward so I wanted to address that um for Mr
45:19
wisemore when he watches this uh video back thank you George all right um so can I have a
45:25
motion to close the public he on agenda item number one motion close motion by
45:30
montos can I have a second second second by St all in favor I I all right so now
45:37
we have some discussing to do um George legal legal question um if
45:46
this variance is granted um and there are no conditions other than the normal
45:51
conditions that we put on it and it's determined that uh the structure needs
45:58
to be completely rebuilt they could rebuild a completely new structure in that same space is that correct that is
46:04
correct and um you could even food for thought if you're concerned about sort
46:10
of if the structure is completely it needs to be demolished all the way down
46:15
um and you don't want them to now have the ability to have a one foot setback all the way in the middle of the
46:20
property on the other side of the property you could always condition on using that same exact building and if it
46:26
has to be rebuilt the the building in the same exact spot so sort of to the uh
46:32
description of the applicant here um that alleviates any concerns with granting a variance and then oh we you
46:39
know we can't use that building anymore let's move it into the property and still use that one foot setback so that
46:44
is a feasible condition here if that makes sense okay um thank you uh so I we'll go
46:51
through uh the factors and discuss as as we as we do um so as to whether an
46:58
undesirable change will be produced in the character of the neighborhood or a detriment to nearby properties will be
47:05
created by the granting of the area variances and we'll take them together I
47:11
suppose unless anybody has an objection there uh anyone wish to speak
47:20
first I think the property is historic I think it's been there for a long time
47:27
I think the way it looks is great and if it was restored it would be a real Plus for the
47:32
neighborhood uh so no I don't think it would be any detriment thank
47:38
you I agree it's hard for me to comment if an
47:44
undesirable change will be produced given the fact that it is in that
47:49
particular Zone because there's so many supporting
47:54
letters and only one may maybe challenging letter on the record so it's
48:00
difficult for me to say that an undesirable change will be produced um so I just don't know the
48:06
answer to it elen anything to add
48:12
um I also don't know if it would be undesirable it's a far more intensive
48:17
use than it's been previously used for so it's hard to judge whether it would
48:24
be bad or good yeah I I think yeah I mean I think that that prong has
48:29
you know the two it's undesirable I mean that's obviously subjective detriment to nearby properties I I keep reading you
48:36
know it's you know it's hard to say um I think you know based on what we have on the record
48:42
um you know when weighing uh the intent of the zone and you know what is what is
48:50
the intensity of the use that's going to be changed I don't know I'm I'm not willing to say it is a detriment um
48:58
not willing to say that it's not a detriment so I think I'm neutral on on one uh would be where where I where I
49:03
land on that um as to whether the benefit the applicant seeks can be
49:08
achieved through another method feasible for the applicant to pursue that does not require the area
49:15
variances I mean I'll comment on that I think we made a potential thought
49:21
earlier on extending the existing building then be no issues at all
49:27
so I think it can be achieved other ways to achieve getting a third
49:35
unit um the part it won't achieve is getting an Roi on the investment on
49:41
rebuilding the existing Barn whatever we call that unit
49:47
yeah so I think this one's interesting um because it talks about feasibility
49:53
and so if if you take the benefit the applicant seek as the two that he stated
49:58
he's seeking which is to restore the current structure that's there and then
50:04
to also you know recapture some of the cost of
50:09
that no right but if it's determined that it can't be
50:16
restored then the benefit changes because the the first desired benefit is
50:21
eliminated at that point and so then the question is does it change the calculus
50:27
of of the um of the variance or how we're or how
50:33
we're you know coming to understand the variant but the um the the the notion of
50:40
the exact physical building the exact beams and components of that
50:47
building um if it was completely destroyed there's still a value which I
50:52
think he was trying to express of resurrect ing potentially a completely new
50:59
building that's in the same size space look feel because after all that
51:06
building has been there for a hundred years and so remaking it would have value
51:15
aesthetically and in terms of the the value of conserving that look and feel
51:24
of that property to the owners the residents and neighbors I think that has
51:30
some intangible value and so it's not simply you know the beams and and nails
51:38
that are there that's that's a a question yeah I do agree with you there
51:44
I guess you know if nothing was there and we were
51:49
being asked for you know this this question would we say oh well yeah this
51:55
looks great or it would look great but we really want 5T instead of one foot
52:01
you know even if we're not going to say oh we don't want it to be one house you know because that is not aesthetically
52:07
pleasing it it takes away all the things that were said um but we would we say oh
52:13
well you know 5et 6 feet I don't know what the number is Right would make more sense than one foot one and a2t like but
52:20
he's not proposing building it from scratch today correct and of course that
52:25
house has been there that building and the out building they've been there 100 years so could we could we propose that
52:33
could we condition it on that if it did have to be completely rebuilt
52:39
that it would require bigger
52:45
setbacks
52:51
George is there a foundation uh there's Pres
52:58
no a slab um it is again this is an ancient
53:07
building so what what stands as a foundation right now is really big
53:13
pieces of blue stone it's pardon me really big pieces of blue stone stone
53:18
blue stone that's what stands underneath uh underneath this so the the and um it
53:25
may well be the same blue stone that was used on the sidewalks in Beacon that have since been replaced in many places
53:31
not everywhere but in how would you even correct that structure without building a proper Foundation oh it it gets a
53:38
proper Foundation that's in the in the plans so it in the rebuilding of this in
53:44
that same footprint it's getting it's getting footings in a proper so what percentage of the building would be
53:52
rebuilt I I'm sorry I don't follow what percentage I mean we're going to you're going to rebuild a
53:58
foundation we're going to build a foundation there's no rebuild of the foundation there is no pre-existing
54:03
foundation so what could you use of the existing don't the walls have to all come down and no you can you can
54:10
potentially lift the structure up put the foundation in and that's what you're going to do that is the intention yes as
54:17
much as is possible correct if if I may just the conversation I had with the architect with r seagull was that that's
54:25
what they're going to do so this the intention of this was to save the building support it and then replace the
54:32
foundation you know technically in sections so but again it's with the anticipation that they were going to
54:40
save the structure itself correct got it yeah I'll just stay here just in
54:50
case George so I think Judy's question was um
54:56
my question was if it had to be rebuilt could we condition it that it had to have five five foot setbacks it would
55:04
you have to move it you know the only way that you can have the one foot setbacks is if you can rebuild this
55:11
structure um if you can't and you have to build a new structure do you then have to come back and get new V you know
55:17
the the one foot variance does not stand I you could easily achieve both side and
55:24
rare if you rebuild it to to me well this is what I'm saying I'm saying if you had to rebuild the whole thing maybe
55:31
you'd have to come back so you're saying predicate a potential approval only if the structure doesn't have to be
55:37
rebuilt I'm saying if you leave the structure where it is we can leave the setbacks exactly where they are leave
55:44
everything exactly where it is but if you have to redo it then you have to
55:51
come back and see if you could get a one foot setback from us and yeah that's uh
55:57
my initial thought on that is that's essentially saying condition it on using
56:02
that same structure if that's instead of saying if it can't be done you have to come back to move it in it's saying if
56:09
it can't be done this approval doesn't apply so you can condition it on using
56:14
that exact same structure exact same footprint let's say that exact same footprint gets to be used which is the
56:22
applicant's intention yes right which I I get that in in effect we're saying saying once again we would approve the
56:28
current setback yes it which we've already done once before correct what they're doing it would be an approval
56:34
conditioned on using that same structure now if during the construction process Rea comes back or whatever engineer
56:40
comes back and says all of this has to come down we got to put some fill back there whatever the case is level it out
56:47
with a condition like that it would require the applicant to come back and say okay well we couldn't use that structure here's what we are proposing
56:54
and it might be moved in toward the middle it might might be in the same area it's up to the board but a
56:59
condition on using the same structure is I I think appropriate yes do you I
57:04
wouldn't even say the same structure I would say the same footprint of that structure you'd have
57:11
to so keeping the the proposed setbacks now as well yeah that could that could also
57:18
same exact spot condition it on using either the same structure or a new structure in that same exact spot same
57:24
footprint same dimensions same Dimension same a replica structure replica bar
57:29
there you go replica and that's easier because that's what he's asking for that it is what he's asking for so yeah I
57:36
think it's an appropriate condition and it sounds like the applicant has no concern with that as well the ask yes I
57:42
thought people were talking about if you had to move it and well because technically without a condition like
57:48
that so that's what I was speaking to I thought other people were saying that if you had to move it or something like
57:53
that that's what I thought you guys were talking about on the line of questioning earlier it seemed like it was going to
57:58
is there feasibility to move it somewhere else right if if the structure that's what I was speaking yes and by
58:04
granting the variance generally speaking without such a condition theoretically it opens the door to say okay well I
58:10
have this 1
58:25
18.51% any concern and they don't have to come back and In fairness we were having those discussions for the factor
58:32
of can it be achieved by a different way yes so we were having those discussions that's kind of what I speak but if one
58:38
of the goals is they wanted to be exactly in that location where a building has stood for a 100 years then
58:46
achieving that can't be done by moving it around but that's not I didn't hear location was the driver I heard the
58:51
building itself was the driver and the ROI and the Rebuilder of the two no no no he very clearly stated over he used
58:58
the term soul of the building but I I think the notion is that there's a a
59:03
value in continuing the presence in that lot in that
59:09
space uh that building or a a replica of it to continue the history of the
59:15
property if the building is not at all reusable and it's a complete tear down
59:23
and they have to rebuild I don't think asking to come back
59:30
for different variances is a big ask it's not going to destroy the soul of
59:38
the property if you move that building over 5et or pulled it up closer to the back
59:46
of the original house I disagree it it's not that Earth
59:52
shattering what's been there for the LA for as long as I've lived there has been
59:59
falling down I don't know how many people alive remember what it originally
1:00:06
was if if they can't restore what's there and they have to go to a
1:00:12
new a new build then they have the opportunity to give a little and pull it
1:00:19
up and move it over some uh George assuming we
1:00:28
um we decide to make that a condition
1:00:35
um how what how do we how how would there be any enforceability on
1:00:41
complete right like I mean there was well there was mention of right sure there was mention of one beam
1:00:49
and I know in my world uh if you're rehabing a
1:00:55
house and you have one beam you don't get the implied warranty um because it's not a new construction technically
1:01:01
because there was one beam left or at least there's legal arguments to say that yeah um what what are your thoughts on that
1:01:09
that would be a building department uh you know sort of determination and if
1:01:15
there's anything in the code off the top of my head I I don't I don't know off the top of my head um but if there's
1:01:20
nothing in the code it would be the building department determination and I imagine you know
1:01:26
it it really comes into question if it's you know one piece of limestone or one whatever that that could be used and
1:01:33
everything else has to come out right if it's 50% of it or 25% has to be taken
1:01:39
apart I I don't think that's a big issue but it would be building department enforcement and determination as to um
1:01:47
salvageability I guess we had a prior case when we talked about X percentage of the structure being that with a fire
1:01:55
yeah that was a use variance so right but we at one point well it was there were a combination of things right area
1:02:01
they were talking about area and use of various times in the arguments and they were throwing out a percentage of what
1:02:07
was that percentage of so that's in the um nonconforming um pre-existing nonconform structure 50% if it's if it's
1:02:14
destroyed by more than 50% then it could no longer exist right
1:02:20
um that was I believe was the Grand that's correct they luse so 50% be a
1:02:26
reasonable figure to apply to something like this to consider complete re I think it it would be yes so if it was
1:02:33
more if more than half of it was you know taken down and yes I believe um you
1:02:40
know it would it would basically you know shouldn't exist anymore under that Statute in the code now with a lot of it
1:02:46
being down already do we think it's right now it's not so even if they had
1:02:53
saved two walles let's say you know part part of the roof structure that's about 50% of it you know and they rebuilt the
1:03:00
front you know the front wall and the other side wall you know that might be feasible for them you know just to keep
1:03:06
it in the same place so it'd be 50% of the existing structure would be part of the future structure right it doesn't
1:03:13
have to be 50% of the future structure comes from the old building comes from the old building right so once 50 once
1:03:20
it's more than 50% remove then you know it would you know technically under that
1:03:25
section the codes it would it would cease to exist but that that section of the code
1:03:30
was for loss of a non-conforming use yes yeah right so not necessarily applicable
1:03:36
here but but we we could use con a standard conceptu you know we could use that theory in our in our condition
1:03:42
correct we can borrow borrow from it in theory right okay all right let's continue um as to whether the requested
1:03:49
variance is substantial yes
1:03:55
yes those are very small setbacks yeah I mean I think mathematically they're um about as
1:04:04
substantial as you can get yes I guess
1:04:10
so no comment you can disagree it's okay to disagree no comment as to whether the
1:04:18
proposed variants will have an adverse effect or impact on the physical or environmental conditions in the
1:04:24
neighborhood or District I don't think so no
1:04:29
no I don't know I don't see anything that would um as to whether the alleged
1:04:37
difficulty is self-created yes yes yes yes of course
1:04:43
um and then so you know this one kind of speaks to what we've been talking about
1:04:49
the whole time I think so uh is this the minimum are these the minimum variances
1:04:54
necessary in adequate to preserve and protect the character of the neighborhood and the health safety welfare of the community no yes no
1:05:04
yes yes right it's keeping the thing in the same place so so I think this speaks
1:05:11
to what we were talking about right so I think I think that it it they are um if
1:05:17
they're able to use what they have I think though if they are not able to use what they have then I think my answer
1:05:23
would be would be different hence the previous discussion uh hence the as
1:05:29
risk sure right so um that's why you
1:05:35
know if I if I were to propose a motion which I'm not going to I'm going to ask one of you to um I would condition it
1:05:45
uh as to as as to our discussion before um because I think that that this this
1:05:51
Factor um weighs on that on the on their ability to preserve and protect the
1:05:58
character of the neighborhood um I agree with that so with that being
1:06:04
said um anyone want to try to put together a motion I just want to comment
1:06:10
that I don't agree that there should be some percentage notion of how much of
1:06:15
the existing structure should be retained in order to allow them
1:06:21
to uh fix that building up by one means or another connected to the other
1:06:27
building and uh you know come to the outcome that they desire because I don't
1:06:33
think it really makes much difference if it's
1:06:40
57.6% or 177% of existing Lumber in the building
1:06:47
being used or not and to to that extent as I'm thinking out loud from a legal
1:06:54
perspective if for for example the board said 50% has to be retained and there's
1:07:00
a 52% can't even really determine percentages right it's easy if there's
1:07:05
four walls and you keep two that's an easy thing you could argue that two one wall is shorter than the other so it's
1:07:10
not 50% whatever the case is the the concern I think is if you say 50% and uh 45% is salvaged and they have
1:07:20
to come back the applicant comes back for basically a new application and says hey I want to build in the same area we
1:07:26
have 45% of the building um the zoning board would have already granted those
1:07:32
area variances twice so it would be uh a little depending on what's left it would
1:07:39
be a little difficult to say well with 50% of the building it would have been fine because we've already granted them
1:07:45
twice but with 45% of the building not it's a little I just want to be clear
1:07:51
though the first granting of the Varian is we're not considering awell unit on
1:07:56
top the we denied it because of that purpose so but the area variances were granted for the structure correct yeah
1:08:04
and that's the only thing we're considering now not necessarily what it's used for the yeah the only thing in front of us right now is the area Varan
1:08:11
is on the third unit right but we were talking about we talked about access from fire engines if there was an
1:08:19
emergency you know and if it were just a barn mhm the impact of granting the ices
1:08:26
was less as opposed to IND a family was living there so I just want to be clear
1:08:31
the situation then is not an apples apples it's not an Apples to Apples but the difficulty legally when it would be
1:08:39
you granted the variances at one point it's the same exact variances then you have to get into how the circumstances
1:08:44
have changed I'm not saying absolutely it's not Apples to Apples but um it's not necessarily apples to zebras either
1:08:52
right it's uh the variances would have been granted and if they're granted again today a third time would be you
1:08:58
know you have a precedent sort of to follow so why are they even back because they they need the Varian well I mean if
1:09:04
we granted the variances once already now aspect they tied the building
1:09:10
together why they a different it's a different project it's a different application because of the Breezeway it
1:09:15
is uh that those approvals don't apply first of all the approvals expired as well so that's one thing but um from the
1:09:23
moment there was a Breezeway it was determined that this is a new application so a new application new
1:09:28
appearance new presentation would need to be made that's why but it is the same variances so uh you know the
1:09:35
circumstances haven't really changed since then in terms of the area variances got
1:09:43
it anyone want to take a shot at a proposal for a
1:09:48
motion I move would we accept this proposal and Grant him the variances all right so we have a motion
1:09:55
uh to approve the variances with the normal uh the normal restrictions I assume all right second which for the
1:10:03
applicant edification right uh are the normal restrictions is uh no permit or
1:10:10
Co unless you want to give this yeah no no permanent Co issued until you've paid
1:10:15
all application fees um and consultant fees incurred by the city and then um you have to obtain a building permit
1:10:23
within 6 months from the date of the adoption of the res res solution commence construction within 6 months
1:10:28
following the date of the issuance of the building permit and complete construction and obtain a seal within 24
1:10:33
months after the issuance of the building permit um just again for the record those are the only two conditions
1:10:38
in your proposal all right so we have a we have a motion that motion uh by montos we have a second motion was sorry
1:10:46
Sor sorry monos okay I'm Rusty motion by Stow with those
1:10:53
conditions we have a second by Judy and so now we will call uh the role uh so uh
1:11:01
Elaine no no montos yes all right I am a
1:11:06
yes Judy yes yes sto yes yes all right
1:11:12
you have passed congratulations can I have a motion to open the public hearing on agenda item
1:11:18
number two motion can I say thank you I just and I appreciate your thoughtfulness about this I I realize
1:11:25
this is a big thing so thank you thank you for both granting in the variance and for your thoughtful consideration of
1:11:31
it so and uh I look forward to you seeing the new building good luck yeah
1:11:38
um I think I have a motion motion to open um agenda item number two yes all
1:11:44
right motion open public hearing uh on agenda number two by Judy can I have a second second second by sto all in favor
1:11:50
I I
1:11:57
I don't understand this yeah well gentlem by way of uh introduction I am
1:12:04
the uh the owner and tenant of 112 Washington uh excuse me could you speak up should Sor or into the microphone
1:12:11
yeah there we go uh the owner tenant of 112 Washington um I do not have any
1:12:17
electronic material today to present but I know there's at least two maybe three printed out material um for everyone to
1:12:24
to see here um so I'm here um asking for a area
1:12:31
variance to uh to attach a 5 by 9 foot
1:12:37
deck to the front of our house on Washington a Facing East could you speak into the microphone more I'm having
1:12:42
trouble hearing you okay um put take the microphone put it closer your mouth yeah all right right into it that's better
1:12:49
much better than sure okay [Music] um so the the front deck got yeah front
1:12:57
deck um I I don't believe that there had been any
1:13:03
um thinking through uh we're recent homeowners um and I know that there were
1:13:09
some approvals um um when the the the Reconstruction
1:13:15
was done over the last couple of years and so moving into the space there are two sort of sliding front doors on the
1:13:24
exterior wall that faces Washington a which we are then looking to place the deck right outside of there
1:13:32
um beyond the deck we intend to put um some babber Hedges to sort of soften up
1:13:38
the deck space and provide semi natural fencing to the front windows that are on the
1:13:44
property um but ultimately just looking uh to have a small space on the front of
1:13:50
the house for um what is not a multigeneration
1:13:55
family yet um we have a couple of young kids and are just always happy to be outside and want to spend some time in
1:14:04
the front of the house versus just being in the back of the
1:14:10
house and so without me rambling and think beyond that um I I
1:14:16
hope that the the print outs are descriptive and showing what we're looking to do and what was previously
1:14:22
approved and
1:14:28
I'll stop there and ask for questions so that's on the front of the house it is the front that's unusual really
1:14:36
unusual this is the sort of thing that people mostly put in the back of yeah why wouldn't you want to put that on the
1:14:42
back so there there is already a sort of a stone patio that's out on the back
1:14:47
side of the house uh I think it's just coming from a sense of wanting to have
1:14:53
more of a connection into it's a very quiet neighborhood and to use the space
1:14:59
to sit out front um to be able to as I we're relatively new to the neighborhood
1:15:05
and we see a lot of young families which we are we have a two and a foury old that a young family sort of walking by
1:15:11
two and from we're one block away from the bus uh but in the current in the current positioning
1:15:18
there's no use of there's no access to the front of the house at all the entrance is sort of on the side of the house and so um we lose access to the
1:15:27
the sort of the Eastern views of the mountain but as well as just again the I
1:15:32
ask a question because yeah I I guess I just didn't realize that there's no opening on this to
1:15:39
this the open the opening to the house is on the side you said yeah the open the opening the main is on the side and
1:15:46
there's a stone pathway that goes up into the side of the house and that's on this side over here correct yeah
1:15:51
directly where your your your your finger was so looking at is the left hand side side right yes so this is just
1:15:58
a an extension of the house that doesn't have a staircase for a door and like an
1:16:04
egg rest that you use to come and go it it actually does that that that wall has
1:16:10
it's a wall of Windows and two sliding doors that open entirely but there's
1:16:16
nothing there it's a um I think it's roughly a 16inch step down to the ground
1:16:21
so it almost looks like it was built for there to be a front is there still a ramp there now there's
1:16:28
nothing there at all it's just directly to that was added this that whole section was added on when they rehab the
1:16:35
building there was an addition put on actually Bruce I have a question sliding
1:16:40
glass doors there now yeah there's there's two floor to ceiling sliding
1:16:45
glass doors that are there now the addition it was too large I remember there being two large Windows there I
1:16:51
don't remember if it was a sliding glass door but uh yeah they're they're French doors
1:16:57
seven and a half to8 foot Florida Florida ceiling yeah they're Florida Florida yeah two windows sliding door
1:17:04
yeah and then and then next to them are fixed windows so maybe it's four panels the two slide open
1:17:12
um that one I have a question on this
1:17:18
layout this bump out before the deck I assume is the addition where those
1:17:24
sliders are correct the former Edition right and then there's the deck now the deck is
1:17:30
going to be run at its longest point9 ft
1:17:35
from the new edition uh 5T and then 9 ft wide I think five 5tet out six feet with
1:17:42
the step sorry 5T is the top deck and then well this says nine the deck is 9
1:17:48
by Six Wide yeah nine nine wide and six 9 by six would be the bottom footprint
1:17:54
and and then from the house to the last
1:18:00
step is 9 ft I think that should be the six feet
1:18:06
no sorry well the steps come out on on the
1:18:12
width yeah the the the there's the deck and
1:18:17
then there's the deck steps that come down some go all the way around the last
1:18:22
one doesn't that's right it's on a slope to so that one comes at it winds up
1:18:28
being 9 ft right yeah so the setback is 20
1:18:35
ft and this says that's the sun porch lot line to
1:18:42
the that last step is 10 ft and if from that last step to the house is 9 ft that
1:18:50
means the addition is one foot into the
1:18:55
is already into the setback for the front yard by one foot so what did ask
1:19:00
if the measurements are correct okay so I'll give you a a little
1:19:06
clarification on so there was the original permit when they renovated the house and I believe they built an
1:19:12
addition I think it was on the front and the side um that was issued by uh David
1:19:18
Buckley he issued the permit um for that and when they applied for that permit there's in
1:19:25
the um information that you were given the architect at that time had given Dave a um uh measurements of all the
1:19:34
other streets or all the other houses on the street with the sepa so he allowed
1:19:39
them to go out that extra to be right to be in alignment with the rest of the the
1:19:46
houses on the street so he gave them a variance yes so that that was he allowed
1:19:51
that so by building this deck now which is already one foot
1:19:56
encroached um he needs that variance to go out because with the information that
1:20:01
was provided previously you know all the rest of the houses are back so that exception in the code you know can no
1:20:08
longer be applied mhm yeah I I wasn't assigning that one
1:20:14
foot to his he didn't build the house he bought it right he bought it yeah and
1:20:19
and when he bought it again it was you know that one foot was justified by the prev building inspector when he issued
1:20:26
permit um do that without a variance did what how did he do that
1:20:33
without a variance is basically there's a section in the code that allows it for um the
1:20:39
front of the house to be um in to be in alignment with the rest of the houses
1:20:45
within I think there's a distance in the code need to be a but it's usually the neighboring houses as long as they're
1:20:51
all within the same alignment they could bring it out to that point point but can't go any
1:21:00
further how high is this thing is it here yeah it's 23 in it's
1:21:08
only 23 in at the to the yes to the to
1:21:13
to the existing floor where the door is before the step down so from the grass
1:21:19
it's 18 in at the side so it's shallow it's very
1:21:25
shallow yeah quite shallow yes okay is this the house that you just
1:21:31
showed with the glass yes is there no parking what you have no
1:21:38
driveway it is to the left of the the the main eress the that's over here yeah
1:21:44
so that yep there there's parking for four it's the old school style with two
1:21:52
like two pieces of concrete for your tires and then yeah and then gravel in between
1:21:58
it okay right so this doesn't come in
1:22:04
conflict with any parking or anything like that it does not we hate we hate parking in front of the house now we yes
1:22:12
no we've uh no no conflicts so it's almost basically like putting your
1:22:20
backyard in your front yard so this this nothing else my neighbor has exactly the same TCH just
1:22:27
like this beautiful on the back it's really really nice Bruce there's nothing like this in the neighborhood is there
1:22:34
yeah not really strange no there's nothing that I know I don't think there's anything in
1:22:41
the neighborhood that's similar to this usually it's like a front you know just there would be a front porch that's
1:22:46
about it like a you know a landing with a set of stairs in front of the house right y yeah I think that well you're
1:22:53
not asking for this to that's right I think we're we aren't interested in sort of the entirety of a porch with railings
1:23:00
in a roof just the simple place to sit and have coffee and make conversation
1:23:05
with people that pass by lay papers down there he could do that right if he was to put papers you you know close to the
1:23:12
ground yeah if he was to do ground level favers he could do that it's really the elevation that is bringing in here now
1:23:19
well yeah the only reason he's looking cuz he's building an elevated structure it's really kind of a
1:23:25
elaborate set of stairs really yeah that's that's kind of how I'm looking at it yeah it is and and the stairs are
1:23:31
meant to be a a a place to sit like we don't tend to put a table and chairs or
1:23:37
anything it's meant to just be a easy place to spend maybe five minutes or 30
1:23:42
minutes sitting around the steps okay any other question I would just say
1:23:49
don't put a roof over it can they no
1:23:55
let's not go there please can of worms all right any
1:24:02
other questions uh the sorry thank you turn oh it's off any
1:24:08
other questions for the applicant great anyone from the public wish to
1:24:17
speak you just uh state your name and address for the record Sergey COV 386 libery Street um I do have a question uh
1:24:26
I do work for the company that's designed and building it and this is my project but I am also a neighbor can I
1:24:33
speak as a neighbor or you can speak as either all right so as a neighbor I live
1:24:38
on Liberty Street right around the block I take Washington Street I jog there I take my kids so anything that brings
1:24:45
people out and puts eyes on on the neighborhood it kind of creates more
1:24:51
inclusive it creates safety everybody in their backyards you don't see what's on
1:24:57
the front and we have this problem with uh spitting on Washington and it's kind of like it should be beautiful
1:25:04
neighborhood street and it's almost like a a Speedway so I feel like ring people
1:25:10
out and giving them a reason to be up front in the front yards it makes the
1:25:15
neighborhood safer and better um as a parent with two kids like circularity
1:25:22
and navigation around the house is very very important like you want people to move around jump out se you know and
1:25:30
move around and you know this design kind of allows for this easy access from different sides um where you know I work
1:25:38
for one nature it's a regenerative landscape design construction company uh
1:25:43
with very strong artistic kind of underpinnings for everything we do so it was designed to kind of blend into the
1:25:51
landscape and emerge and kind of you know with a landscaping with uh bab
1:25:56
shrubs around to sulten it and not be like an imposing structure that takes
1:26:02
out from neighborhood we believe it adds to the neighborhood so sorry for confusing my roles no no I app I
1:26:08
appreciate that I think that those are some good points um all right so I will
1:26:14
take a motion to close the public hearing on agenda item number two please motion to close motion by Judy can I
1:26:20
have a second second second by montos all in favor I I all right uh as to
1:26:27
whether of course as to whether an undesirable change will be produced in the character of the neighborhood or a
1:26:33
detriment to nearby properties will be created by the granting of the area variance anyone want to no I don't think
1:26:42
so no I don't think
1:26:47
so well I I do have this one concern it's small um just the the notion that
1:26:53
they're moving the the sense of where the property I
1:26:58
mean the uh the building ends is closer to the sidewalk um but I mean I could I've
1:27:06
heard their the arguments that that makes them more positive for the neighborhood um I'm just worried that
1:27:13
somebody would come before us next year and say I want to build a porch that goes out that far well and so I'm
1:27:21
worried about the uh is it is it a precedent that fact somebody might want to build something that isn't just an
1:27:27
elaborate set of stairs I don't think this is a precedent because that wouldn't be the same thing I agree be a
1:27:33
whole different thing right a whole different kind of apple I you know I think you know for for the for the
1:27:38
record for the video you know the strongest my the reason why I'm not
1:27:44
really concerned about it is because it's 18 in or whatever the number was it's it's not a you know what I would
1:27:50
consider 23 right I I would not consider I mean sure it's a structure by definition but it's not a structure
1:27:57
right so I think I think if this was a a room I would be looking at it
1:28:03
differently completely yeah completely differ railing or something like that I would also say the applicant can simply
1:28:09
put in a paper patio there and and not have to come to us right I think this
1:28:14
proposal is a lot nicer than putting in a paper patio I think that I would be
1:28:19
worried about what precedents that would say right to your point about precedence
1:28:25
so um yeah when we get through the factors we'll go up yeah you
1:28:31
know I agree with both of you guys yeah Elaine anything to add no it makes it it almost makes it
1:28:38
look like they're and an additional entrance and front steps to the
1:28:46
house all right and it also kind of um goes with the design of that house it's
1:28:53
an unusual design first of all everybody I I know that house just just from driving by there uh so
1:29:02
um yeah I have no I agree with everybody all right on that as to whether the
1:29:08
benefit the applicant seeks can be achieved through another method feasible for the applicant to pursue that does
1:29:13
not require the area variance yes they could put in stone
1:29:22
pavers I agree with that well I guess it depends on what you consider the benefit the applicant
1:29:27
seeking right um and a step right I think an aesthetic is part
1:29:34
of the uh the benefit no I said end a step oh well and sure I I think that the aesthetic is is part of the benefit the
1:29:41
applicant is seeking um so you know I could see this one going either way I I
1:29:46
wouldn't say it's determinative in my opinion yeah I kind of agree with it
1:29:52
Lane but I don't see it as a deter issue no all right as to whether the requested
1:29:58
variance is substantial no no I don't think it's
1:30:04
substantial because of the height no I yeah I agree I mean I think you know sure mathematically it's 50% but it's
1:30:11
such a minimal uh height that I I don't think it is substantial when you
1:30:17
consider that um as to whether the proposed variance will have an adverse effect or impact on the physical or
1:30:23
Environmental conditions in the neighborhood or District I don't think so no no no I agree I think uh I think
1:30:32
the applicant's neighbor um pointed out some positives actually um that that
1:30:38
makes sense to me um as to whether the alleged difficulty is self-created yes
1:30:44
yes sure is um and then as to whether
1:30:50
the this is the minimum variance necessary and adequate to preserve and protect the character of the neighborhood and health safety and
1:30:56
Welfare of the community
1:31:03
no they could make it somewhat smaller they could make a walk out I still don't
1:31:08
think it's a it's a problem but it could be smaller I
1:31:16
agree I think it's pretty minimum I mean sure you could always
1:31:21
bring it back bring it back um I don't think it's uh but when you tie
1:31:28
it to the preservation and protecting the character and health safety and Welfare
1:31:33
of the community I don't I don't think does it have anything to do with it yeah really I I don't think few inches here and there wouldn't make any difference
1:31:40
yeah all right um with that being said um if uh if we
1:31:49
Grant the variance um we have our normal conditions which
1:31:55
